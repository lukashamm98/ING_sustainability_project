7,0.2727272727272727,"Review of the year. I am delighted to have the opportunity to write to you as we report . our results. It is now two years since I was appointed Chairman and it . has continued to be a pleasure to work with Simon and the rest of the . Executive team and Board. Our 2019 results have delivered another . year of revenue and adjusted EBIT growth, with revenue increasing . 2.8% to £1,545.0m and adjusted EBIT increasing 3.9% to £214.1m. . Statutory profit after tax decreased by 30.9% as we incurred one-off . costs, including costs related to our strategic supply chain project and, . reflecting the fair value of assets held for sale relating to the proposed . disposal of manufacturing facilities in France. . During 2019, the Executive team has made further progress . in executing the strategy, including:"
7,0.09090909090909091,"• Developing the portfolio to meet emerging consumer needs by . entering new categories and bringing premium offerings to existing . brands in all our markets. • Completing the Business Capability Programme (‘BCP’). The last . four years have seen a significant investment in the fabric of the GB . business, resulting in a transformational change to the supply chain . infrastructure. As a Board we commend the Executive team for the . delivery of this extensive project, which has been achieved without . any major disruption to the day-to-day running of the business. • Expanding the presence of the LEC brand into key cities around . the world. At the same time taking the tough decision to focus . on the Fruit Shoot single-serve market and terminate distribution . of Fruit Shoot multi-pack in the United States. A sign of a strong . management team is being able to recognise when an opportunity . has run its course and look to refocus its energy elsewhere, and the . premium adult category in the United States and further afield is an . attractive one to invest in. • Delivering another year of solid financial and strategic progress . while overcoming significant macro challenges. This includes the . backdrop of uncertainty as the Brexit discussions have continued . across the year, requiring a measured response from the business . to mitigate the risks that might otherwise arise"
7,0.6363636363636364,"Dividend. As a result of the financial progress made this year, the Board has . proposed a final dividend of 21.7 pence, an increase of 6.9% on the . 2018 dividend. The full year dividend of 30.0 pence, represents a 6.4% . increase on last year."
7,0.36363636363636365,"Culture . The Board and Executive team have a vital role to play in shaping . and embedding a healthy corporate culture, and this continued to . be a focus in 2019. Our responsible, inclusive and diverse culture, and . the values by which we hold ourselves accountable, ensure that our . colleagues consistently do the right thing for our stakeholders. Of . course, there is always more to do and getting this culture right is . critical to our success in an increasingly competitive environment."
7,0.45454545454545453,"Directors . In October last year we announced the resignation of Mathew Dunn . as Chief Financial Officer. In his three years with Britvic he made a . significant and positive impact and on behalf of the Board I thank him . for his contribution. Following his resignation, the search for a new . CFO began and I am delighted to report that in March this year we . appointed Joanne Wilson to the role. Joanne joined us from Tesco, . where her last role was CFO of dunnhumby, its data science . subsidiary. With extensive commercial and retail, as well as financial, . experience I believe she will be a real asset to the business in the . years ahead.. The composition of the Board brings a range of views and . experience to Britvic and both supports and challenges the Executive . team in the execution of the strategy. The Board and the Executive . team have spent time together this year shaping the strategic focus . for the years ahead. As well as regular Board meetings, the Non-. Executives are on hand to support Simon and his team throughout the . year and we make ourselves available to answer shareholder questions . both at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) and during the course . of the year."
7,0.5454545454545454,"Remuneration . Our approach to reward aims to link remuneration with the delivery . of the Group’s key strategic objectives while delivering long-term, . superior and sustainable returns to shareholders. We believe in . offering fair remuneration, where colleagues are rewarded for . performance aligned to the long-term sustainable success of . the business. . More information on how we ensure that our approach to . remuneration supports our strategy is available in the Directors’ . Remuneration Report on page 60."
7,0.18181818181818182,"Looking ahead . Britvic has a fantastic portfolio of brands and a dedicated and . passionate team working hard to deliver excellent outcomes.

8,0.5555555555555556,"Brtivic has delivered another strong financial performance, once again . proving our resilience in a challenging and uncertain environment. . Through the consistent execution of our strategy, our portfolio of . fantastic brands and passionate and committed team, we have . now delivered six years of continuous adjusted EBIT growth.. In 2019 we have grown revenue by 1.4%* to £1,545.0m, . adjusted EBIT by 4.4%* to £214.1m, and adjusted EBIT margin by . 40 bps*. Since launching the strategy in 2013, we have delivered . adjusted earnings per share CAGR of 9.2%, a dividend per share . CAGR of 8.5% and total shareholder returns significantly ahead of . both the FTSE100 and FTSE250.. Below are the performance headlines against our four . strategic pillars:"
8,0.6666666666666667,"Generate profitable growth in our core markets. GB. Against a backdrop of softer consumer demand, we have focused . on consistent execution of our commercial plans, which has resulted . in increased revenue and brand contribution in both our carbonates . and stills brands. The GB soft drinks market (as measured by Nielsen) . has continued to grow value at 2.3%, while volume declined 1.3%. . As a year on year comparison, these figures must be set against the . backdrop of exceptional summer weather in 2018. Our well-positioned . portfolio benefited from the continued trend toward low and no sugar . brands, with Robinsons, R Whites, Tango, Pepsi MAX and 7UP Free . all in strong revenue growth."
8,0.2222222222222222,"The new Robinsons brand extensions launched last year have . continued to be very successful, with the Cordials range the number . one brand in the premium category. The combined retail market . value of Creations and Cordials is £32m. Fruit Shoot performance . has stabilised this year, gain+ing market value share, while J2O was . in decline, driven by a weaker performance in the on-trade. Robinsons . Refresh’d, Lipton Ice Tea and Purdey’s all grew strongly.. Pepsi had another very successful year, with revenue growth of . over 6% and further gains in market share. The growth was driven by . our continued focus on no sugar Pepsi MAX, including the continued . success of the cola Taste Challenge campaign and the introduction  . of Pepsi MAX Raspberry – the biggest soft drinks launch of 2019. . Pepsi MAX is now, by volume, the biggest cola variant in GB. During . the year we also relaunched Tango, with a range of new flavours, a . pack redesign and a multimedia marketing campaign. Tango revenue . grew by 13%, gained market share and attracted 900,000 more . shoppers – resulting in the brand’s highest retail market value in five . years. While partially offset by declines in regular 7UP, we are delighted . with the performance of 7UP Free, which is now the number one . lemon and lime variant in GB."
8,0.4444444444444444,"France. It has been a challenging year in France, with performance particularly . disappointing in the second half of the year, as both the private label . and branded business performed below expectations. The introduction . of the EGalim law earlier in the year has had a major impact. The . law was introduced primarily to rebalance commercial relationships . between smaller suppliers and retailers by specifying minimum limits . on retailer margins and a maximum on supplier volumes sold on . promotion. The consequence of this legislation is a price increase for . our branded products, which has adversely impacted our volumes in . the grocery channel. In this legislative environment, many companies . have found their growth challenged and this has led to further intense . competition across our branded portfolio. . We recently announced that we were in exclusive discussions . with Refresco over the potential sale of our three juice manufacturing . sites in France, our private label juice business and the Fruité brand. . The proposed transaction is subject to a consultation process with . the relevant employee representatives, which is now underway, and . competition clearance by the French Competition Authority. As part . of the transaction, Pressade and Fruit Shoot would be supplied by . Refresco under a long-term manufacturing agreement. The transaction . will not affect the Teisseire and Moulin de Valdonne brands or the . private label syrups business, which will continue to be manufactured . at the remaining site in Crolles.. The proposed transaction would complete in spring 2020, . creating a smaller but higher margin business in France, enabling . the local management team to focus on growing our profitable . brand portfolio."

9,0.6666666666666667,"Ireland. 2019 was a more challenging year for the Irish business, compared . to a strong performance following an exceptionally hot summer in 2018. . While MiWadi and Pepsi MAX grew, we lost share overall due to the . growth in the energy category, where we have a limited presence, and . a softer performance in the water and full sugar carbonates categories. . The Counterpoint wholesale business performance reflects a . contraction in the on-trade channel, with third-party brands in the . beer and cider categories under-performing."
9,0.33333333333333337,"Realise global opportunities in kids, family and  . adult categories. In Brazil, we have now delivered six consecutive quarters of . revenue growth, with signs of improvement in the macroeconomic . environment. We lead the liquid concentrates segment in Brazil and . continue to take share through the development of our three brands; . Maguary, Dafruta and Bela Ischia. Overall, the concentrates category . performance has been subdued and we are currently developing new . liquids and pack formats to lead its rejuvenation. . Across the portfolio we have launched a range of new pack . formats, enabling increased distribution across the different regions . of Brazil. Fruit Shoot growth has been accelerated by the introduction . of a smaller 150ml pack format, which has increased affordability and . enabled distribution gains primarily in the North East region. We have . also continued to expand our category presence across a number of . new segments. Examples include our coconut water brand, Puro . Coco, the Natural Tea range and Maguary Selecao, a premium . grape juice.. In Brazil we buy and process fruit direct from the farm. Once . our internal requirements are satisfied, our marketing company ‘Be . Ingredient’ sells the remaining processed fruit to business customers . around the world. Demand for this business is growing. We also now . use our business in Brazil to procure certain fruits, on behalf of . the Group, such as oranges and passionfruit. . In the United States, despite the success achieved with . increased distribution in Walmart from 2018, we do not believe . sufficient momentum has been generated in Fruit Shoot multi-pack to . build a sustainably profitable business. As a result, we have taken the . decision to exit the multi-pack operation and refocus our resources in . the United States on the growth opportunities in our partnership with . PepsiCo for Fruit Shoot single serve and with London Essence, our . premium mixers and sodas brand. . More broadly internationally, we delivered double-digit revenue . growth in Teisseire. This was led by the expansion of the premium . Mathieu Teisseire range, targeted at flavouring coffee and alcohol, . and the Zero sugar free range in grocery in the Netherlands, where . revenue increased 37%. The travel and export channel also generated . strong growth this year."
9,0.16666666666666669,"Continue to step-change our business capability. This year we completed our GB Business Capability Programme, . which has transformed our supply chain infrastructure over the last . three years. Over this time, we have installed 10 new production lines . and three new on-site warehouses. We have also invested in the . footprint of the supply chain to provide space for further expansion, . and standardised the production processes across the sites, to help . drive consistency and operational efficiency. During September 2019, . the Norwich site closed, as we consolidated production at Rugby, . London and Leeds. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our . employees affected by the closure for their commitment to the very . end, and I wish them well for the future.. The programme is delivering benefits ahead of previous . guidance, with the final cost savings due to be realised in 2020. . We will now move into the optimisation phase, focusing on our . production and network efficiency through a continuous improvement . programme, and on realising the substantial commercial benefits now . at our disposal. We are enjoying significantly increased capacity, most . notably in cans and 1.5 litre PET, where we have step-changed our . ability to compete and are taking greatly increased market share as a . result. We are also increasingly realising environmental benefits – using . less power and less packaging, reducing road miles and utilising more . renewable energy.. This programme has been a great achievement by all those . involved, and I would like to thank the whole team for their dedication . and commitment. Their hard work has left Britvic with an exciting . platform for the future."
9,0.5,"Creating a better tomorrow. Our ‘A Healthier Everyday’ sustainable business programme is at the . heart of how we are making a positive difference to both people and . planet. During 2019 we transformed our approach to governing our . ‘A Healthier Everyday’ strategy, combining our former Sustainable . Business Committee with our Non-Financial Reporting Committee . to form a new Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) . Committee. A fuller description of its role and responsibilities can . be found in the Creating stakeholder value section of the annual . report on page 20..

Britvic was a founding signatory to the UK Plastics . Pact, and we are resolute in our determination to be part of the . solution. Nearly 100% of our primary packaging is recyclable, and . we encourage consumers to recycle every time they enjoy one of . our products. We support the proposed UK Deposit Return Scheme, . which will help to create a true circular economy for the recycling . of packaging. . We have entered into a long-term agreement with Esterform, . the largest independent converter of PET in the UK, for the supply of . recycled PET, an important milestone in Britvic’s sustainable business . programme. We are committed to pursuing a sustainable packaging . strategy and critical to achieving this is delivering a step-change . reduction in the use of virgin PET in our packaging and an increase . in the levels of rPET. Under the terms of the agreement, Esterform, . will become Britvic’s preferred supplier of rPET in Great Britain and . Ireland and Britvic will be providing £5m of investment support for . the construction of new rPET manufacturing facilities at Esterform’s . site in Leeds.. We are also committed to Britvic being a truly great place . to be for all our employees. In 2019 our global Great Place to . Work employee engagement score increased a further 4% to 84%, . putting us firmly in the top quartile of global companies. In 2019 we . relaunched our global Diversity & Inclusion (‘D&I’) strategy, B-Yourself, . and set up a representative steering committee to lead this agenda . across the organisation. This year we attained our target of 38% . women in leadership roles across our organisation, and we are . supported by a range of employee networks to promote every aspect . of D&I among our workforce. By way of example, we are proud to . have partnered with Stonewall, a leading LGBT+ charity, which works . with institutions to create inclusive and accepting cultures, to ensure . that they understand and value the huge benefits brought to them . by LGBT+ people, and to empower them as advocates and agents . of positive change. More broadly, as part of enhancing our total . employee experience, we are focusing on creating an emotionally . and psychologically healthy environment, where everyone who works . for us can be their true selves and feel fully supported at work.

Consumers are increasingly concerned about . the amount of plastic packaging they use, with 59% of . consumers claiming they are doing more to reduce the . amount of plastic waste that they generate compared . with last year1. While plastic packaging is an integral part . of the global economy and it provides many benefits, . the traditionally linear value chains currently represent . environmental challenges. By 2050, projected growth . in plastics production could lead, in a business-as-usual . scenario, to the entire plastics industry consuming 20% . of total oil production and accounting for 15% of the . annual carbon budget2. • Today, more than a third of the food sold in the EU . comes packaged in plastic, with estimates suggesting . that, by 2020, Europe will consume more than . 900 billion items of packaged food annually3"
11,0.3125,"The impact. • The food and drink industry, buoyed by legislative . demands and an increasing public awareness of the . plastics issue, is taking action. Retailers have committed . to reducing the amount of plastic packaging in their . products, while global food and drink manufacturers . have made pledges to make their packaging reusable, . recyclable or compostable. Innovative new packaging . technologies, meanwhile, seek to do away with . plastics altogether3. • Consumers are playing their part too. Campaigns  . encouraging shoppers to leave plastic packaging at . supermarket tills are gaining traction as the general . population becomes increasingly aware of the . environmental consequences of the material3.  . However, there is evidence that shoppers still value . convenience and price, and sentiment is not currently . translating into widespread plastic-free behaviour4"
11,0.09375,"How we are responding. • In 2019 we signed a long-term partnership to enable us . to significantly increase the use of recycled PET (rPET) . across our GB and Ireland portfolio of products. In 2020 . we will lead with two brands available in 100% rPET . • All of our PET plastic packaging is fully recyclable in the UK . recycling system and our packaging carries the On-Pack . Recycling Label to encourage our consumers to recycle. • We are investing in research and development to . investigate the use of alternative sustainable materials . while upholding the highest quality and safety standards"
11,0.21875,"What’s happening?. • The desire to live healthier lifestyles continues to be  . the most significant and persistent global megatrend . impacting beverages. • The shift towards natural ingredients is a recurring trend . across food categories, with 66% of global consumers . actively buying natural food/drink products5. • Removal of perceived unhealthy ingredients, especially . sugar, is increasingly important for consumers and . continues to be a focus for governments looking to . address rising obesity levels . • According to Euromonitor’s international survey6, sugar . reduction is at or near the top of consumer concerns . with regard to food and beverage intake in every global . region. This is a truly global concern with obesity now . a bigger global public health challenge than malnutrition. .

12,0.425,"What’s happening?. • Society is in the midst of a global plastics pollution . challenge and there is more public and political . awareness surrounding plastic waste than ever . before. Consumers are increasingly concerned about . the amount of plastic packaging they use, with 59% of . consumers claiming they are doing more to reduce the . amount of plastic waste that they generate compared . with last year1. While plastic packaging is an integral part . of the global economy and it provides many benefits, . the traditionally linear value chains currently represent . environmental challenges. By 2050, projected growth . in plastics production could lead, in a business-as-usual . scenario, to the entire plastics industry consuming 20% . of total oil production and accounting for 15% of the . annual carbon budget2. • Today, more than a third of the food sold in the EU . comes packaged in plastic, with estimates suggesting . that, by 2020, Europe will consume more than . 900 billion items of packaged food annually3"
12,0.55,"The impact. • The food and drink industry, buoyed by legislative . demands and an increasing public awareness of the . plastics issue, is taking action. Retailers have committed . to reducing the amount of plastic packaging in their . products, while global food and drink manufacturers . have made pledges to make their packaging reusable, . recyclable or compostable. Innovative new packaging . technologies, meanwhile, seek to do away with . plastics altogether3. • Consumers are playing their part too. Campaigns  . encouraging shoppers to leave plastic packaging at . supermarket tills are gaining traction as the general . population becomes increasingly aware of the . environmental consequences of the material3.  . However, there is evidence that shoppers still value . convenience and price, and sentiment is not currently . translating into widespread plastic-free behaviour4"
12,0.3,"How we are responding. • In 2019 we signed a long-term partnership to enable us . to significantly increase the use of recycled PET (rPET) . across our GB and Ireland portfolio of products. In 2020 . we will lead with two brands available in 100% rPET . • All of our PET plastic packaging is fully recyclable in the UK . recycling system and our packaging carries the On-Pack . Recycling Label to encourage our consumers to recycle. • We are investing in research and development to . investigate the use of alternative sustainable materials . while upholding the highest quality and safety standards"
12,0.475,"What’s happening?. • The desire to live healthier lifestyles continues to be  . the most significant and persistent global megatrend . impacting beverages. • The shift towards natural ingredients is a recurring trend . across food categories, with 66% of global consumers . actively buying natural food/drink products5. • Removal of perceived unhealthy ingredients, especially . sugar, is increasingly important for consumers and . continues to be a focus for governments looking to . address rising obesity levels . • According to Euromonitor’s international survey6, sugar . reduction is at or near the top of consumer concerns . with regard to food and beverage intake in every global . region.

Across the Group, our focus has been on improving our safety . performance and standardising the proactive mechanisms we have . in place to identify hazards and control the risks from our operational . activities. Key to this has been building our new reporting tool . for health, safety and environment. This will support compliance . with external standards as well as those we set for ourselves . internally. The sophisticated business intelligence offered by the tool . also enables us to access data and respond to trends with greater . agility. Our efforts have also continued to centre on creating a ‘zero . harm’ culture through behavioural safety observations, near miss and . hazard reporting. Engagement with local teams led to the successful . embedding of our Safety Critical Rules, designed to raise awareness and . compliance with our significant risks and controls.

At 29 September 2019, the Group had £945.0m of committed . debt facilities, consisting of a £400.0m bank facility which matures in . 2021, and a series of private placement notes with maturities between . 2019 and 2033, providing the business with a secure funding platform. .

(1 October 2018: net surplus of £86.9m). The net surplus has increased . primarily due to changes in the financial and demographic assumptions, . and additional employer contributions made to the GB plan of £20m. The . defined benefit section of the GB plan was closed to new members on . 1 August 2002 and closed to future accrual for active members from . 1 April 2011, with new employees being invited to join the defined . contribution scheme. The Northern Ireland scheme was closed to new . members on 28 February 2006 and future accrual from 31 December . 2018, and new employees are eligible to join the defined contribution . scheme. All new employees in Ireland join the defined contribution plan. . Following completion of the 31 March 2016 GB plan actuarial . valuation, agreement has been made with the Plan Trustee on a number . of key principles, including allowing a longer period to fund the deficit . and agreeing that no additional contributions will be payable over and . above those payments to 2019 agreed at the 2013 valuation. Future . contributions beyond 2019 will be on a contingent basis. The Ireland . and Northern Ireland defined benefit pension plans have an investment . strategy journey plan to manage the risks as the funding position . improves. The GB pension plan mainly has credit-type investments and . the Trustees have developed proposals to manage the investment risks. . Following the Lloyds GMP equalisation case in October 2018, which . ruled that treatment of men and women be brought in line for schemes . with a guaranteed minimum pension, the vast majority of UK-based . defined benefit schemes will need to recalculate member benefits. . The impact of the GMP equalisation is £6.0m which has been recognised . as a past service cost as part of adjusting items in the current period."
34,0.2,"Risk management process. As with any business, we face risks and uncertainties. We believe . that effective risk management supports the successful delivery of . our strategic objectives.

Executive team performs a formal robust assessment of the principal risks . facing the company annually, which is reviewed by the Board. Similarly, . all business units and functions perform formal annual risk assessments . that consider the company’s principal risks and specific local risks relevant . to the market in which they operate. Risks are monitored throughout the . year with consideration to internal and external factors and the company’s . risk appetite, and updates to risks and mitigation plans are made as . required. The principal risks that could potentially have a significant impact . on our business have not changed since year end and are set out on . pages 35 – 38 of the 2019 annual report."

35,0.17777777777777778,"Our approach. As with any business, we face risks and uncertainties especially as . we look to grow our business here in the UK and around the world. . Effective risk management helps support the successful delivery of . our strategic objectives. We have an established risk management . framework to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor the risks we face . as a business and help deliver a balance between risk and opportunity. . The risk management framework incorporates both a top down . approach to identify the company’s principal risks and a bottom . up approach to identify operational risks. The Executive team is . responsible for identifying, managing and monitoring the principal . risks. The Board is accountable for the overall risk management . process and determining the effectiveness of the Executive team’s risk . management. Similarly, all business units and functions are responsible . for identifying and assessing their risks, both current and emerging, . and measuring them against the defined criteria, considering the . likelihood of occurrence and the potential impact to the company. This . includes an assessment of the movement in the risks, the strength of . the controls relied upon and the status of the mitigation actions. . The viability statement on page 39 provides a broader . assessment of the long-term liquidity and solvency of the company . after consideration of the principal risks."
35,0.15555555555555556,"Key areas of focus. The risks facing Britvic continue to be wide-ranging with both external . and internal factors providing a high level of uncertainty across the . year. This has ranged from common business risks, such as Brexit . and sustainability, through to those more specific to Britvic, such . as moving through the final stages of our BCP. . The company has a Brexit steering group in place to ensure that . we are being proactive in monitoring developments and taking action . where appropriate. Given the continuing uncertainty regarding the . outcome of the Brexit withdrawal process, the steering group has . focused this year on being prepared for a ‘no-deal’ exit and ensuring . that adequate preparations are made where these are within the . company’s control. This has ranged from building additional raw . material stock in the run up to the various Brexit deadlines, securing . additional warehouse space both in GB and Ireland and assessing the . readiness of our suppliers for Brexit. The impact of Brexit including a . ‘no-deal’ outcome has not been presented as a separate risk but . instead is reflected in the relevant principal risks, notably the risks . around supply chain and treasury."
35,0.2222222222222222,"Risk appetite. The UK Corporate Governance Code requires companies to determine . their risk appetite.

During the year the Committee has sought to understand the evolving . expectations of stakeholders around the way that Executives are . rewarded and the implications of the 2018 Code and other initiatives . from proxy agencies and shareholders. The Committee understands . its duty to ensure that Executives are incentivised and rewarded for . the delivery of excellence while at the same time ensuring fairness and . balance. This will be front of mind as we move into the review of our . remuneration policy in the coming year. In preparation for that we have . appointed new remuneration consultants to support the Committee . with its work and have extended the number of times we will meet . to ensure that we have the time to debate and consider any changes."
61,0.047619047619047616,"One of the main activities of the Committee over the last year has been to . set the remuneration package of the Chief Financial Officer. As announced . in March 2019, we welcomed Joanne Wilson to the Board of Britvic as . Chief Financial Officer effective 9 September 2019. The Committee set . Joanne’s remuneration in line with the approved Remuneration Policy, . and being cognisant of the focus on executive pensions, has aligned her . pension to that available to the wider workforce. To secure her recruitment . it was necessary to partly compensate Joanne for payments that would . have been due had she remained at Tesco. The Committee has structured . those, that they have agreed to pay, on the value of awards forgone along . with clawback and deferral provisions as appropriate. The full details of . Joanne’s package are set out in the ‘At a glance’ section on pages 62 – 65."

No payments were made to Mathew . Dunn for loss of office."
61,0.4761904761904762,"Our remuneration principles. Our Remuneration Policy is designed to support our overall vision to . become the most dynamic, creative and trusted soft drinks company . in the world. Our people are at the heart of our business.

61,0.09523809523809523,"The mix between both fixed and variable pay, . as well as the balance between rewarding . short versus long-term performance, are critical . to ensure that we reward those behaviours that . will lead to the realisation of our long-term . vision without compromising short-term gain."
61,0.19047619047619047,"All forms of variable pay are only fully . delivered in return for performance materially . above the standards required by Britvic and our . shareholders – in other words, the superior pay . opportunity available can only be realised in . return for superior performance."

61,0.2380952380952381,"The performance measures selected to . determine both our annual bonus and long-term . incentive plans have been carefully considered . to focus on a simple and effective selection of . those key drivers of our strategy and long-term . value creation for our shareholders."

62,0.2777777777777778,"To ensure the continued alignment of . Executive and shareholder interests, the . greatest potential pay opportunity for Executives . is via our long-term incentive plans. Share-based . awards are dependent on a balance of absolute . and relative growth in long-term value creation . for shareholders. In particular, the mix of share . options and performance shares is designed . to ensure that Executives are only rewarded . for superior market performance and the . realisation of our vision.

The Committee has reviewed the . 2018 Code with advisors and sought to understand its implications . for the company ahead of implementation by Britvic for the financial . year beginning 30 September 2019. The Committee noted that it . is already undertaking substantive elements of the Code, such as . having responsibility for Executive team remuneration, and where . necessary has worked to develop a framework that will allow the . Committee to review broader workforce policies and take these into . consideration when setting Executive pay. The Committee has . considered the Code’s impact on its terms of reference which has . resulted in minor amendments to them, and the revised terms of . reference can be found at www.britvic.com/governance."

Along with previous visits to Rugby, the Board and . Committee can experience the culture first-hand, and garner direct . feedback. This is an area in which we believe it is the role of the whole . Board to be involved; a fuller plan has been developed, with a number . of interventions scheduled for the coming year, and we will report on . their impact in next year’s Annual Report."
62,0.8888888888888888,"Business performance and remuneration outcomes . for the year. As detailed in the Chief Financial Officer’s review, the business . has remained resilient and, despite the pressure on revenues, has . delivered another strong performance. This has resulted in the . following outcomes:"
62,0.7777777777777777,"• Annual bonus payout at 46.9% of the maximum opportunity, . which reflects a decline over last year’s bonus due to the revenue . outturns, although performance on profit and cash flow were  . in line with expectations. • The performance share plan (‘PSP’) awarded in 2016 will vest at . 82.0% of the maximum opportunity. EPS compound annual growth . of 6.5% will realise a 76.0% vesting. This is reflective of the . progress on earnings sustained over the period and is consistent . with the TSR performance that was above upper quartile over the . three year period when compared with the comparator group, and . that element will vest in full. • The Executive Share Option Plan (‘ESOP’) awarded in 2016 will vest at . 76.0% of the maximum opportunity, is aligned to the EPS result noted . above and the sustained EPS growth over the performance period"
62,0.2222222222222222,"The above payouts were agreed by the Committee in the context of . performance against the targets set and the underlying performance . of the business over the respective performance periods. In line with . the remuneration reporting regulations, details of the performance . targets and actual achievement against these are set out in the Annual . Report on Remuneration and I can confirm that no discretion was . exercised by the Committee in respect of the Executive Directors’ . remuneration for 2018/19."
62,0.8333333333333333,"Looking ahead to 2019/20. We will be reviewing our Remuneration Policy in the coming year to be . put to a vote at the 2021 AGM.

82,0.875,"Risk – Inappropriate revenue recognition through . manual journal entries"
82,0.8125,"Refer to the Audit Committee report (page 59); and note 5 of the . Group financial statements"
82,0.5625,"Description of risk. The Group has reported revenue of £1,545m (2018: £1,504m). Given . the market focus on the Group’s revenue performance we consider . there to be a risk in relation to the potential overstatement of revenue. . In addition, management reward and incentive schemes which are  . in part based on achieving profit targets, may also incentivise . management to manipulate revenue recognition in order to help . achieve targets of profitability."
82,0.0625,"There is therefore a risk that management may override controls  . to intentionally misstate revenue by recording fictitious revenue . transactions through inappropriate manual journal entries."
82,0.375,"Our response to this risk. • We understood the Group’s revenue recognition policies (refer to . pages 92 – 93) and assessed the design effectiveness of key . controls and how they are applied.. • At all full and specific scope locations, we tested journal entries . posted to revenue accounts, applying a number of parameters . designed to identify entries that were not in accordance with our . expectations. This included analysing and selecting journals for . testing which appeared unusual in nature either due to size, . preparer or were manually posted and therefore outside the normal . course of business. We verified any such journals to source . documentation to confirm that the entries supported the . revenue recognised. . • For the GB, France, Brazil and Republic of Ireland components, . which together form 92% of the Group’s total revenue, we . performed data analysis over the entire revenue process from . revenue recognition through to invoice settlement. Where the . postings did not follow our expectation, we investigated anomalies . and tested a sample of these entries above a certain threshold to . ensure their validity by agreeing back to source documentation. . • At all full and specific scope locations, we selected a sample of . post period end credit notes and obtained corroborating evidence to . demonstrate that the credit note related to the audit period and had . been appropriately recorded."
82,0.125,"Within International Standard on Auditing (UK) 240 there is a . presumption that there are risks of fraud in revenue recognition. We . therefore evaluated the revenue transactions or assertions which give . rise to such risk in the current period as noted above."
82,0.75,"Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee. Based on our procedures we have not identified evidence of . inappropriate management override in respect of the amount of . revenue recorded."
82,0.9375,"Risk – management override of internal controls . over discounts"
82,0.625,"Description of risk. The risk of material misstatement due to management override of . controls is considered a risk in every audit. Management has the . primary responsibility to prevent and detect fraud. We are required by . professional auditing standards to consider how this risk may manifest . itself and design appropriate procedures."
82,0.4375,"Consistent with industry practice, the Group provides material . discounts to customers. These include promotional discounts, long . term discounts and account development funds which are deducted . from revenue. The accounting for these discounts can be complex . and judgemental."
82,0.25,"Management could manipulate results through incomplete recording . of discounts and related liabilities. We have associated this risk to the . promotional discounts, long term discounts and account development . funds that remain open as at 29 September 2019."
82,0.6875,"Our response to this risk. For all full and specific scope components:"
82,0.5,"• We obtained an understanding of the Group’s processes for the . recognition and management of discounts provided to customers . and assessed the design effectiveness of key controls and how . they are applied.. • We tested the operating effectiveness of the controls in respect . of long term discounts in France.. • We held bi-annual meetings with the customer account teams . within the largest component, GB, to update our knowledge of . the status of customer negotiations and the process by which . discounts have been recorded.. • We performed analytical procedures including the correlation . of revenue to discounts to assess completeness of discounts.. • We performed hindsight analysis, to determine the historical . accuracy of management’s estimation and any required . adjustments to accruals.. • We performed targeted journal entry testing at both the general . ledger and rebate transaction front-end system levels. Our testing . was focused on manual journal entries posted, both to the period . end accruals and to the rebate income statement accounts, with a . particular focus on journal entries posted close to the period end.. • We performed testing on a sample of post year end discounts, both . settled and updated, as evidence of the appropriateness of discount . accruals recognised at the year end. . • We selected a sample of post year end credit notes and ensured . that, where audit evidence demonstrated that the credit note . related to the audit period, that these credit notes were . appropriately provided for in the financial statements.. • For the GB, France and Republic of Ireland components, . we performed data analysis over the entire discount process . from cost recognition in the income statement through to . settlement. Where the postings did not follow our expectation, . we investigated anomalies and tested a sample of these entries . above a certain threshold to ensure their validity by agreeing back . to source documentation."

The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are; to identify and . assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements . due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding . the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through . designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond . appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit. . However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection . of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity . and management."
86,0.33333333333333337,"Our approach was as follows:"
86,0.75,"• We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory . frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined . that the most significant frameworks which are directly relevant . to specific assertions in the financial statements are those that . relate to the reporting framework (IFRS, FRS 101, the Companies . Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code) and the relevant . tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group . operates. In addition, we concluded that there are certain significant . laws and regulations which may have an effect on the determination . of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements being . the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, and those laws and . regulations relating to food safety, environmental, occupational . health and safety and data protection. . • We understood how the Group is complying with those frameworks  . by making enquiries of management, internal audit and those . responsible for legal and compliance procedures. We corroborated . our enquiries through our review of board minutes, papers provided . to the Audit Committee and any correspondence received from . regulatory bodies.. • We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements . to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by . meeting with management from various parts of the business to . understand where it considered there was susceptibility to fraud. . We also considered performance targets and their influence on . efforts made by management to manage earnings or influence the . perceptions of analysts. We considered the programs and controls . that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that . otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior . management monitors those programs and controls. Where the . risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures . to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures included . testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable . assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud . or error.. • Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to . identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified  . in the paragraphs above. Our procedures involved: journal entry . testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals and journals . indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding . of the business; enquiries of legal counsel, group management, . internal audit, divisional management and all full and specific scope . management; and focused testing, as referred to in the key audit . matters section above."

To the fullest extent . permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone . other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for . our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed."

92,0.4210526315789474,"1. General information. Britvic plc (the ’company’) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. It is a public limited company . domiciled in England & Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. Britvic plc and its subsidiaries (together . the ‘Group’) operate in the soft drinks manufacturing and distribution industry, principally in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, France . and Brazil. The financial year represents the 52 weeks ended 29 September 2019 (prior financial year 52 weeks ended 30 September 2018)."
92,0.10526315789473685,"The financial statements were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 27 November 2019."
92,0.7894736842105263,"2. Statement of compliance. The financial information has been prepared on the basis of applicable International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European . Union (IFRS), as they apply to the financial statements of the Group."
92,0.8947368421052632,"3. Accounting policies. Basis of preparation. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis."
92,0.2631578947368421,"The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except where measurement of balances at fair value is . required as explained below. The consolidated financial statements of the Group are presented in pounds sterling, which is also the functional . currency of the company, and all values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million except where otherwise indicated."
92,0.6842105263157895,"Going concern. The directors are confident that it is appropriate for the going concern basis to be adopted in preparing the financial statements. As at . 29 September 2019, the consolidated balance sheet is showing a net assets position of £412.0m (30 September 2018: net assets of £377.3m)."
92,0.736842105263158,"Group reserves are low due to the capital restructuring undertaken at the time of flotation. This does not impact on Britvic plc’s ability to make . dividend payments."
92,0.2105263157894737,"The liquidity of the Group remains strong, the Group has a £400.0m bank facility, on which the Group had drawn down £67m as at 29 September . 2019, with a maturity date of November 2021, and £615.5m of private placement notes which have maturity dates between 2019 and 2033."
92,0.631578947368421,"Basis of consolidation. The consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial information of the company and the entities controlled by the . company (its subsidiaries) in accordance with IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’. Control is achieved when the company:"
92,0.5789473684210527,"• Has the power over the investee;. • Is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and. • Has the ability to use its power to affect its returns."
92,0.3157894736842105,"The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and . expenses are eliminated on consolidation. The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired in the year are included in the consolidated income . statement from the date the Group gains control or up to the date control ceases respectively."
92,0.9473684210526316,"New standards adopted in the current period. Initial adoption of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. This standard introduces new requirements . in three areas:"
92,0.5263157894736842,"• Classification and measurement: Financial assets are now classified based on the objective of the Group in holding the asset and the . contractual cash flows. • Impairment: A new expected credit loss model is used for calculating impairment on financial assets. A loss event does not have to occur . before credit losses are recognised. • Hedge accounting: New general hedge accounting requirements allow hedge accounting based on the Group’s risk management policies . rather than only prescribed scenarios. There is currently an option to defer the transition of hedge accounting under IFRS 9."
92,0.4736842105263158,"On 1 October 2018, the Group adopted IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which replaced IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and . Measurement’. As there was no material impact from the adoption of this standard, the Group has not restated the comparative information . relating to prior years."
92,0.15789473684210525,"Financial assets principally relate to trade and other receivables, which are initially measured at the transaction price as determined under IFRS . 15. These are then subsequently measured at amortised costs, as are prepayments and accrued income. The classification and measurement . requirements of IFRS 9 did not have a significant impact on the Group, as the Group continued measuring all financial assets previously held at fair . value under IAS 39 at fair value. The adoption of IFRS 9 has had no impact on the Group’s accounting for impairment losses for financial assets, . as the replacement of IAS 39’s incurred loss approach with the forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach had no net impact."

93,0.7142857142857143,"3. Accounting policies continued. Financial liabilities principally relate to trade and other payables, bank loans, accruals and deferred income. Under IFRS 9, debt instruments are . subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, amortised cost, or fair value through OCI. The Group’s financial liabilities are measured . at fair value, with the bank loans being net of attributable transaction costs."
93,0.6428571428571429,"IFRS 9 Impairment. The IFRS 9 impairment model is applicable to the Group’s financial assets including trade receivables and other receivables as described in note . 17. As the majority of the relevant balances are trade receivables to which the simplified model applies, this disclosure focuses on these balances."
93,0.07142857142857144,"For trade receivables the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but . instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on . its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment."
93,0.28571428571428575,"The provision for credit losses for trade receivables is based on an expected credit loss model that calculates the expected loss applicable to the . receivable balance over its lifetime. This is determined by a number of factors including; the nature of the customer, the payment method selected . and where relevant, the sector in which they operate. The characteristics used to determine the groupings of receivables are the factors that have . the greatest impact on the likelihood of default."
93,0.21428571428571427,"Sensitivity to changes in assumptions. The most significant assumption included within the expected credit loss provisioning model that gives rise to estimation uncertainty is that future . performance will be reflective of past performance and there will be no significant change in the payment profile or recovery rates within each . identified Group of receivables. To address this risk, the Group reviews and updates default rates, by customer group, on a regular basis to ensure . they incorporate the most up to date assumptions along with forward-looking information where available and relevant. The Group also considers . regulatory changes and customer segment specific factors that may have an impact, now or in the future, on recoverability of the balance. While . forward-looking information is usually considered to be immaterial, the exception to this could be the forecast occurrence of a significant one-off . event. The Group does not believe that Brexit will have a material impact on the outstanding receivables balance."
93,0.42857142857142855,"Hedge accounting: The Group has decided to continue to account for hedging relationships under IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: recognition and . measurement’ and will review when to adopt the hedge accounting for IFRS 9 at a future date. On adoption there is not expected to be any . material change in hedge accounting for the Group."
93,0.5714285714285715,"Revenue recognition. The Group recognises revenue from the sale of soft drinks to the wholesale market. Revenue is recognised when control of the goods has . transferred, being when the goods have been shipped to the customer. Following delivery, which is determined to be the time of shipment, the . customer has full discretion over the manner of distribution and price to sell the goods, has the primary responsibility when on selling the goods  . and bears the risks of obsolescence and loss in relation to the goods. A receivable is recognised by the Group when the goods are delivered to the . customer as this represents the point in time at which the right to consideration becomes unconditional, as only the passage of time is required . before payment is due."
93,0.35714285714285715,"Revenue is the value of sales, excluding transactions with or between subsidiaries, after the deduction of sales related discounts and rebates, . value added tax and other sales related taxes. Rebates to customers are deducted from revenue where the amounts paid are sales related or in . relation to a good or service which results in an increase in sales in the customer’s outlet and therefore is not distinct from the sale of soft drinks . to the customer and comprise:"
93,0.8571428571428571,"Long term discounts and rebates . These discounts are typically for months rather than weeks and are usually part of the trading terms agreed with the customer. Long term . discounts fall into three main categories:"
93,0.5,"• Fixed – a defined amount over a period of time. • Pence per litre/case – a pence per litre/case rebate, based upon volumes sold. • % of Net Revenue – a percentage of Net Revenue, which may have associated hurdle rates"
93,0.7857142857142857,"Short term promotional discounts. Promotional discounts consist of many individual rebates across numerous customers and represents the cost to the Group of short term deal . mechanics. The common deals typically include BOGOFs, 3 For 2, and Half Price deals."
93,0.14285714285714288,"Account development fund. The account development fund represents customer promotional activity which promotes Britvic’s products in the customer’s outlets. The Group agrees . to pay the customer various amounts as part of the trading investment. Where these amounts are payable in relation to a good or service which result in . an increase in sales in the customer’s store only, e.g. in-store promotional activity, management has concluded that this is not distinct, and it is accounted . for as a reduction in revenue. Where these amounts are payable in relation to a good or service which result in an increase in group sales more broadly, . e.g. participation in tradeshows or market research, management has concluded that the payment is for a distinct good or service. Where amounts paid . to customers are deemed to be for a distinct service these are included as selling and distribution costs in the income statement."

94,0.631578947368421,"Where the consideration, the Group is entitled to, will vary because of a rebate, refund incentive or price concession or similar item; or is . contingent on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event, e.g. the customer meeting certain agreed criteria, the amount payable is . deemed to be variable consideration."
94,0.368421052631579,"The Group uses the most likely method to reflect the consideration that the Group is entitled to. Variable consideration is then only included to the . extent that it is highly probable that the inclusion will not result in a significant revenue reversal in the future. Accruals are made for each individual . promotion or rebate based on the specific terms and conditions of the customer agreement. Management make estimates on an ongoing basis to . assess customer performance and sales volume to calculate total amounts earned to be recorded as deductions from revenue."
94,0.8421052631578948,"Contract liabilities. Contract liabilities are recognised where, as part of a contract with a customer, the Group has received consideration where the Group will either . need to return that consideration or deliver future services and goods in respect of this consideration."
94,0.8947368421052632,"Property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.

94,0.736842105263158,"Business combinations and goodwill. While the original acquisition of Britannia Soft Drinks Limited was accounted for under the merger method, business combinations on or after . 4 October 2004 have been accounted for under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred . in a business combination is measured at fair value which includes recording deferred consideration at discounted values where the impact . of discounting is material."
94,0.052631578947368425,"On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the . cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the . fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (discount on acquisition) is credited to the consolidated income statement in the period of acquisition."
94,0.4210526315789474,"After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill . acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to . benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units."
94,0.2631578947368421,"Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit (CGU) and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated . with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in . these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained."

Software expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated. . Acquired computer software licences and software developed in-house are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring . to use the specific software. Costs include resources focussed on delivery of capital projects where the choice has been made to use internal . resources rather than external resources. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years on a straight line basis."
95,0.5333333333333333,"Trademarks, franchise rights and customer lists. Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at the fair value of consideration paid. Following initial recognition, . intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation or impairment losses. An intangible asset acquired as part of a business . combination is recognised outside goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition, if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal . rights and its fair value can be measured reliably."
95,0.4666666666666666,"The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Amortisation is charged on assets with finite lives on a straight-. line basis over a period appropriate to the asset’s useful life."

95,0.13333333333333333,"Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are also tested for impairment annually either individually or, if the intangible asset does not generate . cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, as part of the cash generating unit to which it belongs."
95,0.06666666666666667,"Such intangibles are not amortised. The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether an indefinite . life assessment continues to be supportable.

95,0.2,"Following initial recognition of development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and . accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete and available for use. It is amortised over . the period of expected future benefit. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually."
95,0.4,"Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate . that the carrying value may be impaired. For all remaining intangible assets the Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication . that an asset may be impaired. Where impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount or . the recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) to which the asset belongs if it does not generate largely independent cash flows."
95,0.26666666666666666,"An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, . unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying . amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing . value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects senior management’s . estimate of the cost of capital. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the consolidated income statement in those expense . categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset."
95,0.33333333333333337,"An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer . exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is . reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was . recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the . carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. .

96,0.9,"3. Accounting policies continued. Financial assets. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at . fair value, which is normally the transaction price, plus directly attributable transaction costs for those financial assets not subsequently measured at . fair value through profit or loss. The Group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired."
96,0.6,"Loans and receivables. The Group has financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or . determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value . through profit or loss or available for sale. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money . is significant. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired."
96,0.8,"Provision for expected credit losses of trade receivables . Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day terms, are recognised at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount."
96,0.1,"Provision is made for Expected Credit Losses (ECL) when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable. Balances are written off when . the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote. The provision rates are based on days past due and based on the Group’s historical observed . default rates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed."
96,0.55,"The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. . The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions."
96,0.15,"The information about the ECLs on the Group’s trade receivables and contract assets is disclosed in Note 17."
96,0.85,"Supplier financing arrangements . Management reviews supplier financing agreements to determine the appropriate presentation of balances outstanding as trade payables or . borrowings, dependent on the nature of each arrangement. Factors considered in determining the appropriate presentation, impact on the Groups . working capital positions, credit enhancement or other benefits provided."
96,0.2,"Balances outstanding under current supplier financing arrangements are classified as accounts payables."
96,0.95,"Fair value. The Group measures financial instruments, such as derivatives, at fair value at each balance sheet date."
96,0.05,"Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the . measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:"
96,0.65,"• In the principal market for the asset or liability; or. • In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability."
96,0.75,"The fair value of an asset or liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, . assuming that market participants act in their best economic interest."
96,0.5,"The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstance and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, . maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs."
96,0.3,"All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, . described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:"
96,0.45,"Level 1:  quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.. Level 2:  other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly. . Level 3:  techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data."
96,0.35,"For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have . occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period."
96,0.7,"Derivative financial instruments and hedging. The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with . foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently remeasured at fair . value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative."
96,0.25,"The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity . profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments."

For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is documented at its . inception. This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how . effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective."
97,0.5,"Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the consolidated . income statement. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature . of the hedging relationship, as follows:"
97,0.35714285714285715,"Cash flow hedges. Hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with . a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging . instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement. Amounts . previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated income statement in the period in which the hedged item . affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale occurs. However, when the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or . liability, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability."
97,0.28571428571428575,"If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the . consolidated income statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation . as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are then . transferred to the consolidated income statement or included in the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above."
97,0.6428571428571429,"Net investment hedges. Financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign operations. Some of the . Group’s foreign currency borrowings qualify as hedging instruments that hedge foreign currency net investment balances. The effective portion . of gains or losses on translation of borrowings designated as net investment hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. Any . ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Upon disposal of the associated investment in foreign . operations any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recycled through the consolidated . income statement."
97,0.42857142857142855,"Fair value hedges. Hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets or liabilities are classified as fair value hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss . on the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in the consolidated income statement. The gain or loss on the hedged item attributable . to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognised in the consolidated income statement. If the hedge . relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedged item would no longer be adjusted and the cumulative adjustment to . its carrying amount would be amortised to the consolidated income statement based on a recalculated effective interest rate. The fair value gain . or loss on the hedging instrument would continue to be recorded in the consolidated income statement."
97,0.7857142857142857,"Derecognition of financial instruments. The derecognition of a financial asset takes place when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire, or when the contractual rights to the cash . flows have either been transferred or an obligation has been assumed to pass them through to a third party and the Group does not retain . substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset."
97,0.07142857142857144,"Financial liabilities are only derecognised when they are extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires."
97,0.7142857142857143,"Share-based payments. The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted. Fair value . is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any . performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares (‘market conditions’)."
97,0.21428571428571427,"The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance . conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (‘vesting date’). The cumulative . expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period . has expired and the number of equity instruments that, in the opinion of the Directors and based on the best available estimate at that date, will . ultimately vest (or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described below). The consolidated income . statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period."
97,0.14285714285714288,"No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which . are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied."
97,0.8571428571428571,"Taxation. The current income tax expense is based on taxable profits for the period, after any adjustments in respect of prior periods.

Provisions are not recognised for future . operating losses."
98,0.5263157894736842,"Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects . current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of . time is recognised as a finance cost."
98,0.6842105263157895,"Pensions and post retirement benefits. The Group operates a number of pension schemes. These include both defined benefit and defined contribution plans."
98,0.2631578947368421,"Defined benefit plans. The defined benefit pension liability or asset in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit . obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. The cost of providing benefits is determined using . the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial . gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the statement of financial . position with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.

98,0.3157894736842105,"Past service cost is recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying . the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset."

It will eliminate the . classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases for the lessee and, instead, introduce a single lessee accounting model. Lessor . accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from today’s accounting under IAS 17."
100,0.368421052631579,"In summary, IFRS 16 seeks to align the presentation of leased assets more closely to owned assets.

100,0.2105263157894737,"From an income statement perspective, the IAS 17 operating lease charge is replaced by depreciation and interest. IFRS 16 therefore results in . an immaterial impact to operating profit, which is reported prior to interest being deducted. Whilst depreciation reduces on a straight-line basis, . interest is charged on outstanding lease liabilities and therefore for any given lease, interest is higher in the earlier years and decreases over time. . As a result, the impact on the income statement below operating profit is highly dependent on average lease maturity."

This is in contrast to the funding valuation where prudence is a requirement . when assessing the value of the liabilities. This, in combination with the plan being invested in relatively low risk assets as part of the funding . strategy agreed, results in the funding valuation being expected to show a higher deficit than the accounting valuation. The benefits of adopting . a low risk approach to funding is that there is less volatility expected in the company’s future contribution requirements."
116,0.45833333333333337,"In addition when comparing the surplus/deficit, consideration of the different dates of valuations need to be taken into account.

116,0.16666666666666669,"IFRIC 14/ IAS 19 relates to the Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction. The Trustee of the Plan previously . made a change to the Rules of the Plan to clarify that any surplus may be returned directly to the Company without prior Trustee approval on the death or . leaving of the final member of the Plan. The Group has therefore assessed gradual settlement of pension scheme assets for the basis of the asset . recognition and in determining the amount recorded for the net defined benefit asset. Potential trustee rights to augment additional benefit have not been . considered in assessing the amount of the net defined benefit asset. Furthermore, any such refund should be treated as income for tax purposes. These . two points should mean that IFRIC 14 does not have any practical impact on the Plan and so no allowance for it (and, in particular, no allowance for the . asset ceiling) has been made in the calculated figures. BETUS is treated as unfunded for the purposes of IAS 19, so IFRIC 14 is not applicable."

The key factors that will affect the need for additional . contributions include levels of long-term inflation and interest rates and the assessment of how long members are expected to live, along with . the level of investment return achieved. The level of investment return achieved is subject to a range of risks typical of the asset classes held, . in particular market risk on equities, credit risk on corporate bonds and exposure to the property market.

A corresponding credit is recognised within equity. . Fair value is determined by using an appropriate, widely used, valuation model.

139,0.21428571428571427,"1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued. Cash flow hedges. Hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk . associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain . or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the profit and loss . account. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the profit and loss account in the period in which the . hedged item affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale occurs. However, when the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a . non-financial asset or liability, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying amount of the . asset or liability."
139,0.07142857142857144,"If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the . profit and loss account. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation . as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and . are then transferred to the profit and loss account or included in the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above."
139,0.14285714285714288,"Fair value hedges. Hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets or liabilities are classified as fair value hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss . on the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in the profit and loss account. The gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the . hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognised in the profit and loss account. If the hedge relationship no . longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedged item would no longer be adjusted and the cumulative adjustment to its carrying . amount would be amortised to the profit and loss account based on a recalculated effective interest rate. The fair value gain or loss on the . hedging instrument would continue to be recorded in the profit and loss account."
139,0.7857142857142857,"Issued share capital. Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as . a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds."

139,0.6428571428571429,"Merger reserve. The merger reserve arose as a result of the non pre-emptive share placement which took place on 21 May 2010. It was executed using a structure . which created a merger reserve under Section 612-3 of the Companies Act 2006."
139,0.42857142857142855,"Own shares. The cost of own shares held in employee share trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders’ equity until the shares are cancelled, . reissued or disposed.
