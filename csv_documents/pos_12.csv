It was observed that the system boundaries of different wood-based fiber producers  .   differ from the Lenzing Group’s boundaries. In particular, upstream production of chemicals that are consumed in Lenzings’s facilities belongs to scope 3, according to the GHG    .  . protocol, so they should not be included here. However, some Lenzing Group sites produce chemicals themselves, namely H2SO4 and CS2, leading to a higher energy demand    .  . and scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions for the Lenzing Group. This is relevant for all indicators. Scope 1 emissions are calculated from emission factors from EU ETS. Scope 2 emissions   .  . are calculated using a market-based method. . j) Employees (incl. apprentices, excluding supervised workers) in Austria, the Czech Republic, United Kingdom, USA, China, Indonesia, India, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Korea,  .

More than ever, this promise is reflected . in our actions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lenzing quickly . took steps to keep operations running and to reduce the effect . of fiber prices and demand for fibers, which had come under . pressure. These efforts always focused on protecting our employees and strengthening long-standing partnerships . with suppliers and customers. Lenzing managed to stay fully on track even during these challenging times and did . not lose sight of its strategic goals, including the ambitious climate goals, but rather continued to implement them . with great discipline."

11,0.5714285714285715,"For Lenzing, like for so many others, 2020 was over-. shadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns in . virtually all markets had a savage impact on the entire . textile and apparel industry. We focused our efforts on . maintaining our sustainable business trajectory and en-. suring the health and safety of our employees and part-. ners up and down the value chain."
11,0.28571428571428575,"For all the urgency of the fight against COVID-19 and . its effects, we must not forget pressing ecological chal-. lenges such as the climate, biodiversity and resource . conservation. Sustainability is and remains the dominant . issue of our time. At Lenzing, we believe meeting these . challenges is an integral part of our strategic principles . and our responsibility to future generations. It is this re-. sponsibility and our own ambition that we have tried to . express in our #alettertoachild multimedia campaign."
11,0.42857142857142855,"That is why we continued to work resolutely to achieve . our strategic goals despite the difficult market condi-. tions in 2020. Our hard work has paid off: Key projects . in Brazil and Thailand – the construction of a dissolv-. ing pulp plant and a lyocell plant – are still on schedule. . They will not only support our transformation into a sup-. plier of environmentally compatible specialty fibers but . will also significantly help us to achieve our ambitious . climate targets."
11,0.14285714285714288,"The new site in Brazil will export more than 50 percent . of the electricity it generates to the public grid as re-. newable energy and will have a positive net carbon . footprint once it starts operations.

12,0.5384615384615384,"Our pursuit of science-based targets actively . tackles the problems caused by climate change. In . 2019, Lenzing made a strategic commitment to slash . its greenhouse gas emissions per ton of product by 50 . percent compared to 2017 by 2030. By 2050, we in-. tend to be climate neutral. We want to do our part to . slow the rate of global warming and achieve the goals . of the Paris Agreement and the European Commission’s . Green Deal. In the year under review, Lenzing made . additional significant progress toward its targets by in-. tegrating the production sites and instituting profound . organizational measures."
12,0.23076923076923075,"Two other milestones from the reporting year that ex-. emplify the responsible path that Lenzing and its part-. ners have taken towards climate neutrality are the in-. troduction of the first CarbonNeutral® product certified . fibers under the TENCEL™ brand and the establishment . of the Renewable Carbon Initiative, which aims to ac-. celerate the transition to renewable carbon."

56,0.75,"Thomas Obendrauf: Store closures in the retail sec-. tor caused demand for textiles and apparel to plum-. met worldwide in the first two quarters of 2020. In . the USA and major European markets, revenues at . some brick-and-mortar stores dropped by more . than 80 percent. Demand and capacity utilization did . not recover and significantly increase until the third . quarter. As a result, revenue declined 22.4 percent . compared to the previous year. The speedy imple-. mentation of a broad set of measures mitigated this neg-. ative effect and allowed us to come out on top overall.  .  . What has Lenzing done on the expense side to coun-. teract the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis?"
56,0.41666666666666663,"Thomas Obendrauf: In order to soften the effect of the . pressure on fiber prices and fiber demand, Lenzing in-. tensified measures for structural earnings improvement . in the reporting period, thereby reducing its operating . costs significantly. Personnel expenses declined due to . a hiring stop and use of furlough schemes at the Aus-. trian locations.

66,0.7647058823529411,"The most important materials procured are (in order of annual pro-. curement volume): wood, dissolving wood pulp, caustic soda, sul-. furic acid, sulfur, carbon disulfide, sulfur dioxide, and magnesium . oxide."
66,0.35294117647058826,"All of the Lenzing Group’s suppliers must comply with the Lenzing . Global Supplier Code of Conduct. Wood and pulp suppliers addi-. tionally have to comply with FSC® or PEFC™ standards."

Lenzing conducts regular audits as well as specific evaluations of . both new and established suppliers for sustainability and compli-. ance with environmental and safety standards. Suppliers are in-. terviewed regularly and evaluated under environmental and safety . aspects with the support of external experts. A final assessment is . then conducted. It affects the overall supplier assessment and con-. stitutes a major criterion for long-term cooperation with suppliers. . Past supplier assessments have found no violations of environmen-. tal, social, or ethical standards that could have led to the cancella-. tion of existing supplier contracts."
66,0.11764705882352942,"Lenzing’s most relevant suppliers are those that have an increased . risk due to their size and volume. They represent 80 percent of glob-. al purchasing volume including dissolving wood pulp but excluding . wood. The EcoVadis online tool is used to evaluate these non-wood . suppliers. Evaluations of the non-wood suppliers found no violations . of environmental, social or ethical standards that could have led to . the termination of existing supply contracts in the reporting year."

66,0.5294117647058824,"Demand for fibers decreased sharply in the second and third quarter . of 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis. As a consequence, the Len-. zing Group temporarily produced less own pulp and procured less . wood. Many small deliveries from small suppliers who deliver only . once a year were therefore not required, lowering the number of . suppliers from about 700 in 2019 to about 400 in 2020. The suppli-. ers who remained tended to supply larger volumes and have long-. term delivery contracts."

66,0.5882352941176471,"Wood and dissolving wood pulp are Lenzing’s most important raw . materials. The Lenzing Group assumes responsibility by focus-. ing on sustainable sourcing covered by certifications, responsible . consumption, and highly efficient use of these valuable resources. . Lenzing sources wood and dissolving wood pulp from semi-natural . forests and plantations (as defined by the Food and Agriculture Or-. ganization of the United Nations30), not from natural or ancient and . endangered forests."
66,0.23529411764705885,"Precise figures for the absolute amount of wood purchased and . dissolving wood pulp sourced are not provided for confidentiality . reasons. As an indicative estimate, total fiber sales of nearly 1 million . tons require a pulp input of about the same amount. The amount . of wood required to produce this dissolving wood pulp cannot be . stated exactly, especially given all the different processes and spe-. cies that our suppliers use. Assuming a dissolving wood pulp yield . from wood of 40 percent, a rough estimate for the total wood input . would be 2.5 million tons (dry matter), split up between Lenzing’s . own production and purchased dissolving wood pulp."

86,0.5,"This year, Lenzing took its ambition of being a cli-. mate-resilient company further and addressed the rec-. ommendations of the Task-Force on Climate-Related . Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD’s recommen-. dations provide guidance to companies on integrating . climate risks and opportunities into financial and non- . financial reports and eventually aligning climate risks . with the enterprise risk management. The TCFD gives . their recommendations in four areas: (1) governance, (2) . strategy, (3) risk management, and (4) metrics and tar-. gets. Lenzing focused on risk management, metrics and . targets in its 2020 analysis."
86,0.21428571428571427,"There are two different categories of risks at the bot-. tom of the TCFD recommendations: On the one hand, . there are political, legal, technological and market risks, . known as “transition risks”. On the other, there are acute . and chronic risks, known as “physical risks”. Transitional . risks arise from transitioning to a low-carbon economy . (e.g. regulatory changes), whereas physical risks are en-. vironmental risks leading to negative acute or chronic . impacts on a company (e.g. water scarcity or extreme . weather events)."
86,0.07142857142857144,"In 2020, a Group-wide TCFD assessment process was . implemented with the goal of identifying, prioritizing, . quantifying and mitigating climate change risks and . seizing opportunities in Lenzing’s operations and in its . supply chain. The process was designed to allow the . integration of identified risks and opportunities into the . enterprise risk management. To manage climate-related . risks and opportunities, Lenzing established a high-level . ESG committee with the Managing Board and leaders . from functions such as sustainability, business manage-. ment, strategy, investor relations, controlling, and risk . management. The team began by conducting a TCFD . analysis and evaluating potential impacts along the . Group’s supply chain. This yielded a risk and opportuni-. ty inventory. The collected risks and opportunities were . then qualitatively assessed in two climate scenarios:"
86,0.7857142857142857,"• 2 °C Global Warming Scenario (IEA ETP 2DS) – high . mitigation scenario"

87,0.875,"84 . Sustainability Report 2020 Lenzing Group"
87,0.625,"Risks and opportunities were evaluated within the sce-. nario analysis for their short-term (1-2 years), mid-term . (2-5 years), and long-term (5-30 years) consequences. . The qualitative analysis was then used to extrapolate . and qualitatively assess key risks and opportunities in . order to estimate their potential financial impact and . probability of occurrence. Lenzing then derived a KPI . scorecard with indicators and targets on the key cli-. mate-related risks and opportunities based on the . TCFD recommendation for metrics and targets."

Lenzing operates, carbon-intensive processes, regulations on . greenhouse gas emissions have already been implemented (energy . efficiency improvements, regulated emission allowances) and . stricter regulations that would increase the costs of greenhouse gas . emissions are under development."
87,0.125,"Lenzing is implementing stringent energy efficiency measures . in order to reduce its potential exposure to green taxation. In . 2019, Lenzing set a science-based target (SBT) to reduce its . greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1, 2 and 3) by 50 percent per . ton of pulp and fibers sold by 2030 (compared to a 2017 baseline). .

Despite its sustainable sourcing . policy and backward-integrated production, wood prices are at . risk of increasing due to climate change, growing global biomass . demand, and alternative land use. Growing competition for land . use and natural resources is affecting long-term structural biomass . prices."
87,0.0625,"In order to mitigate the risk of increasing biomass costs and . improve supply chain security, Lenzing is building a modern . dissolving wood pulp plant (DWP) with integrated plantation and . forest operations in Brazil.

87,0.3125,"Reputational risk in the textile sector"
87,0.375,"The textile industry, where Lenzing’s products are commonly used, . is being scrutinized for its sometimes unsustainable and resource-. intensive raw material consumption and production processes. . Polyester and conventional cotton in particular face structural . issues that could lead to negative media coverage and further . stigmatize the sector, which could, in turn, influence the Group’s . revenue."

COVID-19 pandemic and the correspondingly challeng-. ing market environment forced temporary shutdowns of . production lines or even whole sites, which led to a sig-. nificant decrease of primary energy consumption (table . 12). However, pulp production was not affected as hard . as fiber production, thus no such changes occurred for . the consumption of renewable energy, mainly prepared . by Lenzing’s biorefinery systems. The resulting increase . in the share of renewable energy shows not only at . the pulp production sites but also at the Group-level  . (figure 14)."
92,0.2,"In the same way, specific consumption of primary en-. ergy follows the downward trend of the company’s de-. carbonization strategy, which is based on reduction of . energy consumption and improving the energy mix (see . also figure 14). For example, in 2020 the Lenzing sites . obtained renewable electricity from the public grid, . which now applies for both Austrian production sites . for the first time. Constantly implementing optimization . steps and energy consumption reduction measures also . positively influence emissions of CO2 (table 13) despite . the effects of unstable market conditions on produc-. tion, especially of fibers.

94,0.09090909090909091,"Lenzing will deploy different levers based on technical feasibility . for scope 1 and 2 emissions. They can be broadly grouped under . four categories (see figure 15). Innovation is the Lenzing Group’s . core competence and what allows it to launch new products that . reduce climate-related impacts on the downstream value chain. . Those avoided emissions are currently outside the scope of the sci-. ence-based target methodology, so Lenzing will not claim them as . part of the company’s target achievement. However, the following . levers are key to achieving the committed target:"
94,0.16161616161616163,"• The first lever addresses energy efficiency. Relevant measures . include replacing inefficient pumps, optimizing current tech-. nologies, planning efficiently, and further reducing losses to . save energy. Better stewardship ensures efficient running of . equipment with strict maintenance scheduling and immedi-. ately responses to malfunctions and leaks. Additionally, energy . efficiency improvements will be supported by cross-learning . and taking advantage of synergies among the Lenzing sites and . industry peers."
94,0.1111111111111111,"• The second lever concerns fuel. Reducing and avoiding the use . of fossil fuels by switching from high-carbon fuels to low-car-. bon or carbon-neutral fuels (scope 1) as well as scaling up the . procurement of renewable grid electricity (scope 2) will make a . major contribution to target fulfillment."
94,0.13131313131313133,"• Third, Lenzing seeks future growth with integrated pulp and . fiber production facilities. “Integrated” means that pulp and fiber . production are combined at one and the same site. This has two . effects: It provides renewable bioenergy for fiber production . and also saves energy by avoiding pulp drying and pulp trans-. portation. This will ensure economic growth while reducing the . Group’s CO2 emissions. Other opportunities will be explored, . including virtual integration, i.e. using surplus renewable electric-. ity produced at one production site at another site in a different . location."

112,0.25,"Scientific collaboration is deeply rooted at Lenzing’s . R&D. This includes participation in big, institutional-. ized cooperative research centers such as the Austrian  . Wood K plus competence center. Wood K plus is a . leading research institute for wood and wood-related . renewable resources in Europe. Lenzing is its largest in-. dustrial partner. Recent topics addressed by the compe-. tence center include advanced biomass utilization, lignin . and hemicellulose utilization, and the use of enzymes . in the production process. Lenzing is also a partner in . the new Christian Doppler Laboratory for an efficient, . recycling-based circular economy. The laboratory aims . to provide the scientific knowledge base for efficiently . recovering secondary raw materials from different mu-. nicipal solid waste streams."
112,0.33333333333333337,"Scientific collaboration also includes “cooperative” re-. search projects. These are projects in which Lenzing . teams up with universities, research organizations, and . companies on specific research topics. In another proj-. ect, Lenzing is investigating cellulose-based separator . paper for batteries together with partners from Europe . and Korea. The PSSP project – a collaboration with . the Research Center for Non Destructive Testing and . a number of Upper Austrian industrial companies – ad-. dresses the development of new measurement meth-. ods for the chemical industry."
112,0.41666666666666663,"Bilateral research is also important to Lenzing’s  . approach to scientific collaboration. Noteworthy exam-. ples include its collaboration with the Scripps Institution . of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, . USA, on the biodegradability of cellulose-based materi-. als in maritime environment or its collaboration with the . Linz Institute of Organic Solar Cells (LIOS), Johannes . Kepler University Linz, on the dielectric properties of . cellulosic fibers."

112,0.6666666666666667,"Impacts of COVID-19. R&D work and focus were stamped by the outbreak of . the COVID-19 pandemic, too. Some cooperation had . to be stopped temporarily as the development partners . are located in regions heavily affected by COVID-19 . (such as Northern Italy or India). However, the prioritiza-. tion of the projects was adjusted according to the new . situation."
112,1.0,"Alternative sources  . of raw materials for fiber . production"
112,0.5,"Any plant-based material can potentially serve as a . source of cellulose and hence dissolving wood pulp for  . fiber-making. Lenzing has undertaken extensive re-. search into many different alternative non-wood cellu-. lose sources. Studies have been conducted on sources . such as annual plants like hemp, straw, and bamboo. . In general, annual plants have a higher growth rate per . hectare than trees. Additionally, certain species have . a higher cellulose content. Some of them are already . available in large quantities, especially in the form of ag-. ricultural waste. This can produce an attractive cellulose . yield per hectare; however, the advantages over wood, . the traditional source of cellulose, need to be assessed . case by case."
112,0.16666666666666669,"In its research, Lenzing identifies promising new cellu-. lose sources and carefully considers their availability, . technical feasibility, and economic scalability as well as . the overall ecological impact with respect to Lenzing’s . climate target and circularity approach."
112,0.8333333333333333,"For more information, please see the “Wood and Pulp” . focus paper."
112,0.5833333333333334,"Non-wood-based cellulose may be challenging to use . for a number of reasons. Dedicated research into the . ecological and economic aspects for industrial-scale . production is necessary."
113,0.9,"110 . Sustainability Report 2020 Lenzing Group"
113,0.7,"Availability. Alternatives such as bamboo, straw, and various annual . plants do not yet meet Lenzing’s needs in terms of avail-. ability in the required quality and amount. Many sources . from annual plants are only available in the harvesting . season and are difficult to store for year-round use.  . Annual plants are thus especially suitable for seasonal . production campaigns. Despite specific benefits and . high annual growth per hectare, the material is very . bulky and more costly to transport. This favors obtain-. ing the raw materials locally and keeping production . capacities small."
113,0.6,"Environmental sustainability. The conversion of forest to agricultural land for annual . plants is a worldwide phenomenon that increases the . pressure on all kinds of forests. Its drawbacks can be . seen with oil palm production, for example. Sustainably . managed forests store much more carbon per hect-. are than annual crops. Therefore, this trend adversely . affects the CO2 balance of the entire value chain. The . carbon balance must be thoroughly calculated while in-. cluding all co-products from annual plants."
113,0.5,"Important factors for the environmental impact of the . process include energy consumption and use of pro-. cess chemicals in pulp production. They depend heavily . on the actual process and vary significantly from one . annual plant to the next."
113,0.1,"Dissolving wood pulp can be made with cotton linters, . which are used for viscose production in some regions. . However, the pulping process uses substantial amounts . of chemicals and energy. As most cotton linter pulp fa-. cilities are not state-of-the-art, resource use, emissions, . and waste can be high for cotton linter pulp."
113,0.4,"Another important factor in the sustainability perfor-. mance of annual plants is the management of the ag-. ricultural areas. Highly productive sites need far more . fertilizers and pesticides than forests, causing other . environmental issues. For example, the overall envi-. ronmental profile of large-scale bamboo plantations is . known to be unsatisfactory."
113,0.8,"Technical feasibility. Apart from not causing additional environmental issues, . fibers produced with alternative feedstock must meet . the same quality criteria as wood-based fibers. The . biorefinery process for wood-based fibers is closely . aligned with the raw material. This keeps quality and ef-. ficiency high and yields climate-neutral bioenergy as a . co-product. With non-wood feedstocks, less bioenergy . may be generated as a co-product, requiring additional . energy sources for processing the feedstock into dis-. solving wood pulp, resulting in a potentially negative . environmental impact."
113,0.2,"Annual plants contain more mineral components and . organic substances that have to be removed to pro-. duce high-quality dissolving wood pulp. This purifica-. tion typically requires the use of aggressive chemicals . and causes waste issues. It is a big challenge to develop . new sustainable technologies for these materials while . maintaining product quality and ecological friendliness. . On the other hand, in woody plants such as trees, these . components are concentrated in the bark, which is eas-. ily removed in the first stage of the process."
113,0.3,"Paper industry experiences with these sources are of . limited use since dissolving wood pulp has to meet very . different quality and purity requirements. While modern . breeding and harvesting concepts have been devel-. oped, a new biorefinery process for annual plants still . has to be adapted to the special requirements, not to . mention circulation management for process chemicals . and treatment of impurities originating from the plants. . So far, no established industrial process meets these . prerequisites."

Lenzing . has dramatically reduced sulfur emissions over the de-. cades by closing loops and installing recovery systems. . Although all of the Lenzing Group’s viscose fiber pro-. ducing sites (Lenzing, Austria; Nanjing, China; and Pur-. wakarta, Indonesia) are equipped with waste gas purifi-. cation and recovery technologies, some carbon disulfide . (CS2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) is . emitted from the process itself and from on-site ener-. gy production. The planned carbon disulfide absorption . plant (CAP) project in Indonesia is on schedule. It will . be essential for reducing specific sulfur emissions by  . 50 percent (target 1)."

120,0.6875,"Lenzing operates a quality management system based . on ISO 9001:2015. It forms the basis for all work pro-. cesses and reinforces efforts to achieve complete cus-. tomer satisfaction."
120,0.4375,"All Lenzing fiber products undergo health and safety . testing. However, the ultimate responsibility for con-. sumer health is borne by the companies that manufac-. ture finished products from Lenzing fibers."
120,0.5625,"The Product Safety and Regulatory Affairs team (part of . Global Quality Environment Safety and Health) ensures . that raw materials incorporated into final products are . thoroughly checked and are appropriate for the specific . application."
120,0.1875,"Product Safety and Regulatory Affairs ensures that Len-. zing is up to date with changes to applicable standards . and regulations. The classification (Classification, Label-. ing and Packaging, CLP Regulation) of titanium dioxide . powder, which is used as a dulling agent in some fibers, . was communicated to Lenzing’s nonwoven custom-. ers in order to discuss the potential need for product . changes. Various external factors prevented the con-. tinuation of the activities reported in last year’s sustain-. ability report to transition all the remaining fiber finish . components from animal to vegetable origins."
120,0.5,"The lyocell process uses the solvent N-methylmorpho-. line-N-oxide (NMMO) to dissolve wood pulp. Lenzing . does not manufacture NMMO, but as a main importer . of the substance and as part of its own sustainability . efforts, Lenzing chose to become the lead registrant . for the solvent under the European REACH chemicals . regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and . Restriction of Chemicals) in 2016. Lenzing therefore . commissioned appropriate new toxicity studies to sup-. plement various existing studies initiated by manufac-. turers of the chemical since 1981."
120,0.3125,"The studies included repeated dose toxicity and repro-. ductive toxicity tests. The results of these, and of further . additionally performed in vitro tests on different cell cul-. tures, gave indications of a possible reproductive toxic-. ity effect with the consequence of a reclassification of . NMMO as a reproductive toxicant of category 2 (the . lowest possible GHS/CLP category) in relation to its . potential effects on male fertility."
120,0.9375,"What does this mean for . Lenzing’s lyocell production, . Lenzing fibers and our . customers?"
120,0.125,"No negative implications are known or expected."
120,0.625,"Lenzing’s occupational health, safety and quality poli-. cy and implemented management approaches ensure . that health risks to employees in production are fully . controlled and that our fibers meet all relevant safety, . quality and legal requirements when delivered to our . customers."
120,0.375,"Additional assessment by independent external experts . confirms the safety of our fibers for all anticipated prod-. uct applications and our full legal compliance with re-. gard to the reclassification of NMMO."
120,0.0625,"In short, Lenzing can demonstrate:"
120,0.75,"• safe use of NMMO within all our production pro-. cesses at all our sites;"
120,0.875,"• the safety of our Lyocell products for all anticipated . end uses; and"

142,0.375,"The Lenzing Group has continued to make safety im-. provements even after the 2016 introduction of its . health and safety strategy roadmap, “Heartbeat for . Safety.” The inclusion of clear standards and targets has . also enabled the Lenzing Group to successfully analyze . its performance data, which provides realistic improve-. ment targets based on prior-year analyses."
142,0.25,"The addition of “Heartbeat for Health” has additional-. ly raised awareness and understanding of the correct . practices for chemical use, handling, and storage."
142,0.125,"The Lenzing Group’s analysis uses both lagging and . leading indicators to obtain a clear performance picture. . The lagging indicators include, but are not limited to, . the rate of work-related injuries, the rate of high-con-. sequence work-related injuries, the rate of fatal injuries, . the total recordable injury rate, and the lost time injury . frequency rate. Leading indicators include, but are not . limited to, the total number of reports, the number of . management safety walks, the number of open reports, . the percentage of implemented tasks, and the monitor-. ing of planned safety meetings. Key performance indi-. cators are shown in the table below."
142,0.5,"Workers focus. The Lenzing Group takes measures to ensure those . working for or on behalf of the Group receive the train-. ing and information they need to work safely and leave . work in the same condition they arrived in. Multiple . standards and programs have been created to achieve . this goal through “Heartbeat for Safety” and “Heartbeat . for Health”. One such program included a partnership . with the Institute of Occupational Safety and Health . (IOSH) leading to recognized training by qualified inter-. nal trainers. The training has had an impact within the . Group, more so when this training is combined with . identification of potentially hazardous areas, controlling . of contractual staff, process and machinery safety."
142,0.625,"Workers in the Group can voice their concerns or ob-. servations at safety meetings so they can be reviewed . and appropriate remedial action taken."
142,0.75,"Current performance compared to . previous years. The Lenzing Group may have increased its headcount, . but the tables below still show consistent year-on-year . improvements since the launch of the Lenzing “Heart-. beat for Safety” strategy.

145,0.3,"In addition to conducting safe and environmental-. ly responsible operations with fair business practices, . Lenzing provides support to numerous social and en-. vironmental protection projects, often over many years. . It also promotes local activities, from educational ini-. tiatives to healthcare and infrastructure measures.

145,0.2,"Conflicts of interest and production-related circum-. stances, such as noise, unpleasant odors, and environ-. mental pollution, can nevertheless result in disputes . with local residents.
