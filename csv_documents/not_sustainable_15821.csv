3,0.41666666666666663,"The ongoing decarbonisation of our industry will play a crucial role in tackling  climate . change. Carbon neutrality is therefore our top transformation objective. We  intend . for Mercedes-Benz’s entire fleet of new vehicles to be all-electric by the end of this . decade where market conditions allow. This will go a long way toward enabling us . to meet our climate obligations ten years earlier than required by the Paris  Climate . Agreement (Ambition 2039). Our goal is to make our entire new vehicle fleet carbon- . neutral by 2039 and to ensure that it no longer has any relevant effects on air quality . in inner cities. We plan to achieve this goal by using a holistic approach that includes . ambitious targets for all stages of automotive value creation — from the supply chain . to production, the vehicle use phase, and vehicle disposal and recycling."
3,0.6666666666666667,"Our commitment to all-electric, which is opening a fascinating new chapter in . Mercedes-Benz’s history, is reflected in our capital  allocation. Between 2019 and . 2026, we will reduce our investments in combustion-engine and plug-in hybrid ve-. hicles by 80 percent."
3,0.8333333333333333,"Global sales of electric vehicles continue to boom. New electric-vehicle registrations . in 2020 surpassed the prior-year figure by 43 percent and accounted for  4.2 . percent of total registrations.1 The strongest growth is in Europe, China and . the United States."
3,0.9166666666666667,"The shift to electric mobility is propelled primarily by stricter carbon targets, . the ongoing expansion of charging infrastructure,  government subsidies and . evolving consumer preferences."
3,0.75,"The acceleration of our own shift to electric mobility in the years ahead will . bring about fundamental change across our company. It will also require .  consistently high levels of investment."
3,0.5833333333333334,"We published our Green Finance Framework, which articulates our principles . for using sustainable financing instruments, in the spring of 2020. Our aim . is to tap additional liquidity to fund our transformation, while enabling inves-. tors to invest in our sustainable business strategy and, in particular, in our . all-electric and decarbonisation projects."
3,0.5,"With more and more investors factoring sustainability into their investment . decisions, the demand for green investment instruments is strong. Sales of . green bonds in the first quarter of 2021 were 50 percent higher than in all of . 2020. The Institute of International Finance estimates that global sustainable . debt issuance will surpass USD 1 trillion in 2021.2"

5,0.6,"A profound transformation across all sectors of the economy is  needed . to achieve climate neutrality. This includes the decarbonisation of .  industry and transport, which will require substantial investments.  . This is true for Daimler’s transition to sustainable mobility as well."
5,0.5,"A key aspect of this transition is to steadily reduce our vehicles’ carbon . emissions along the entire value chain. Green investment instruments .  enable us to align our sustainability strategy with our financing strategy . by giving investors the opportunity to fund projects that accelerate our .  transition to zero-emission mobility."
5,0.4,"Ambition 2039, Mercedes-Benz’s pathway to sustainable mobility, includes . bold yet attainable climate-protection targets. We aim for Mercedes-Benz Cars . and Vans’ new vehicle fleet to be completely carbon-neutral – at all links of . the automotive value chain – by 2039. In addition, we recently  announced that . Mercedes-Benz is preparing to go all-electric by the end of this decade where . market conditions allow. Our shift from electric-first to  electric-only will help . accelerate progress toward a zero-emission,  software-driven future."
5,0.3,"In addition, the amount of investments based on environmental, social and .  governance (ESG) criteria has increased steadily in recent years, as has the . number of institutional investors committed to the UN Principles for Respon-. sible Investment (PRI). This offers us the opportunity to differentiate oursel-. ves in debt and equity markets by means of our sustainable business strategy,"
5,0.9,"ambitious targets and transparent reporting. Beyond capital markets, policy-. makers, communities, and citizens want a more purpose-driven, sustainable . economy. Businesses play a key role in this shift, and stakeholders expect .  companies to direct funding toward business activities that are also good for . people and the planet."
5,0.8,"Daimler issued a  Green Finance Framework in 2020. Its purposes are to .  sharpen our profile as a sustainable investment in the fixed income market . and  enable us to tap sustainable financing that will help us achieve our ambi-. tions. The framework articulates the principles according to which Daimler will . use green financing instruments. It was assessed by CICERO Shades of Green, . a subsidiary of the Oslo-based Center for International Climate and Environ-. mental Research (CICERO) in June 2020. CICERO awarded Daimler’s framework . its highest rating (“Dark Green”) and deemed the framework’s governance .  procedures to be “Excellent.”"
5,0.7,"The framework’s structure, which was developed in consultation with  Swedish . bank SEB, is consistent with the 2018 editions of both the ICMA Green Bond . Principles (GBP) and the LMA and APLMA Green Loan Principles (GLP).1 . Daimler’s green bonds and green loans strive to reflect best practices in line . with evolving market standards and the entry into force of the European Union . (EU) classification of environmentally sound economic activities (taxonomy) . and the EU Green Bond Standard."

5,0.1,"1 The Daimler Green Finance Framework is also in line with the updated version of the ICMA Green Bond Principles published in 2021."
5,0.2,"DAIMLER GREEN FINANCE INVESTOR REPORT 2021 6"
6,1.0,"The framework conditions apply to a wide range of debt instruments, including . green bonds, green Schuldscheine (a debt instrument specific to the German . market), green commercial paper and green loans. The proceeds will be used . exclusively to finance projects that directly contribute toward a low-carbon and . climate-resilient society."
6,0.5714285714285715,"Daimler AG made its first issuance under the Green Finance Frame work in Sep-. tember 2020, a EUR 1 billion benchmark bond with a term of ten years and a . coupon of 0.75 percent. The bond, which was more than four times oversub-. scribed, was arranged by BBVA, BNP Paribas, Commerzbank, Crédit Agricole, . SEB and Unicredit. Daimler issued another EUR 1 billion green bond in March . 2021, which was  arranged by BBVA, BNP Paribas, Commerzbank, Deutsche . Bank and Santander. It has a term of 12  years and a coupon of 0.75 percent."
6,0.8571428571428571,"Daimler fully endorses the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals . (SDGs). Although the SDGs are primarily intended to provide guidance to coun-. tries and governments, progress toward the goals will depend to a large  degree . on companies and their ability to innovate and invest. Daimler’s sustainable .  business strategy is closely aligned with the 17 SDGs. The net proceeds from . our green financing instruments will fund various projects that contribute in . particular to SDGs 9 (Innovation, Industry and Infrastructure), 11 (Sustainable . Cities and Communities), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and  . 13 (Climate Action)."
6,0.42857142857142855,"These projects include the research, development and production of zero- . emission vehicles, the production of their drivetrains and the expansion of . charging infrastructure. The proceeds from green financing instruments can . also be used to modernise and upgrade production facilities, to build new .  factories for zero-emission vehicles and their drivetrains and to expand the . recycling of batteries and cells. Other eligible projects focus on conserving . energy and other resources, harnessing more renewable energy, preventing . and reducing waste, and reusing and recycling materials."
6,0.7142857142857143,"The acceleration of our transition toward zero-emission mobility, which is .  exemplified by our shift from electric-first to electric-only, will require a .  consistently high level of investment and funding. Our Green Finance Frame-. work, under which we can issue additional green financing instruments and .  obtain green loans, will play a vital role in generating these funds and thus . in enabling us to deliver on our commitment to decarbonisation and zero- . emission mobility."

Starting in 2022, Mercedes-Benz will have battery electric vehicles (EVs) . in all segments. Looking ahead to 2025, all new vehicle architectures will be elec-. tric-only, and customers will be able to choose an all-electric alternative for every . model. Altogether, we plan to invest more than EUR 40 billion in developing bat-. tery EVs between 2022 and 2030. Transforming our portfolio in this way will help . bring forward the tipping point for EV adoption.6"
9,0.41666666666666663,"The process is already under way. Our sales of plug-in hybrid and all-electric . cars and vans tripled in 2020 and more than quadrupled in the first half of 2021, .  reaching 121,500 units. Of this figure, about 39,000 units were all-electric,  . including more than 19,000 units (+469.4%) of the EQA, EQC and EQV models.  . This accounts for about 10 percent of Mercedes-Benz’s total sales."
9,0.5833333333333334,"The EV shift is picking up speed - especially in the luxury segment, where . Mercedes-Benz belongs.
