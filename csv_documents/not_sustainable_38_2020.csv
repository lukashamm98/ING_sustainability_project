Financial expenses of interest-bearing liabilties for the period were SEK . 1,371 million (1,152), driven by an by an increase in the debt portfolio relat-. ed to acquisitions. At the end of the period, Heimstaden interest rate hedg-. ing ratio was 80 percent (65). Despite this increase, the average interest rate . as of the date of the Statement of Financial Position, including derivatives . and charges for unutilised credits, decreased to 1.8 percent (1.9), driven by . lower credit margins on bank loans and corporate bonds, as well as . changed base rates. The interest coverage ratio for the last 12 months was . 2.8 (2.4)."
90,0.11764705882352942,"The interest rates on approximately 40 percent (49) of the loan portfolio will . change within a year.

A one per-. cent decrease in the base rates would decrease interest costs by approxi-. mately SEK 70 million (-58)."
90,0.05882352941176471,"The difference in sensitivity is due to interest rate hedging and several credit . agreements containing interest rate floor clauses restricting negative base . rates.

In . addition, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance . with Swedish law through the application of the Swedish Financial Reporting .

98,0.16,"Heimstaden presents assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position . based on current/non-current classification. An asset is current when it is:"
98,0.72,"• Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal . operating cycle"

98,0.6,"The accounting policies and methods of computation followed are consistent with . those of the previous financial year."
98,0.84,"G 3. Property acquisitions and business combinations"
98,0.2,"Where property is acquired, via corporate acquisitions or otherwise, management . considers the substance of the assets and activities of the acquired entity in . determining whether the acquisition represents the acquisition of a business (see . accounting policy below).The basis of the judgement is set out in Note G 6 ."
98,0.48,"Where such acquisitions are not determined to be an acquisition of a business, the . cost to acquire the corporate entity or assets and liabilities is allocated between . the identifiable assets and liabilities of the entity based on their relative values at the  . acquisition date."
98,0.32,"Accounting for business combinations. Heimstaden determines that it has acquired a business when the  . acquired set of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process . that, together, significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The  . acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue . producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an organised workforce with . the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it . significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is . considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, . or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs. When Heimstaden acquires a . business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate . classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic . circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes . the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree. Any . contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair . value at the acquisition date. Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess . of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for . non-controlling interests and any previous interest held over the net identifiable . assets acquired and liabilities assumed). If the fair value of the net assets acquired . is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, Heimstaden re-assesses . whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities . assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be . recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of . the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, . the gain is recognised in profit or loss. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured . at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment . testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, . allocated to each of Heimstaden’s cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected . to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of . the acquiree are assigned to those units. Where goodwill has been allocated to a . CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill . associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the . operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in . these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed . operation and the portion of the CGU."
98,0.36,"Accounting for asset acquisitions. For acquisition of a subsidiary not meeting the definition of a business,  . Heimstaden allocates the cost between the individual identifiable assets and . liabilities in Heimstaden based on their relative fair values as at the date of . acquisition. Such transactions or events do not give rise to goodwill."

99,0.16,"Subsidiaries are all entities over which Heimstaden has control. Heimstaden . controls an entity when Heimstaden is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns . from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns . through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date . on which control is transferred to Heimstaden. They are deconsolidated from the . date control ceases. All Heimstaden’s companies are set to have 31 December as . their year-end. Newly acquired companies that have a different year-end are . changed to year-end at 31 December at the earliest opportunity."
99,0.56,"Consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting  . policies for like transactions. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been . changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by . Heimstaden."
99,0.6,"Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on  . transactions between Group companies are eliminated, except where there are . indications of impairment."
99,0.28,"Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are . accounted for as equity transactions - that is, as transactions with the owners in . their capacity as owners. The difference between the fair value of any consideration . paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the . subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling . interests are also recorded in equity."
99,0.32,"When Heimstaden ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is . remeasured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in the . carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying . amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an . associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously . recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted . for as if Heimstaden had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This . may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are . reclassified to profit or loss."
99,0.44,"Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown . separately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, statement of  . comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of  . financial position respectively."
99,0.24,"Associated companies and Joint ventures. Associated companies and Joint ventures are all entities over which Heimstaden has . significant influence but not control or joint control. This is generally the case where . Heimstaden holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in . associated companies and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity . method of accounting, after initially being recognised at cost. Under the equity . method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted . thereafter to recognise Heimstaden’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses . of the investee in profit or loss, and Heimstaden’s share of movements in other . comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends . received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognised as a . reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. Where Heimstaden’s share of . losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, . including any other unsecured long-term receivables, Heimstaden does not . recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on . behalf of the other entity. Unrealised gains on transactions between Heimstaden . and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of Heimstaden’s . interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the . transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. . Accounting policies of equity-accounted investees have been changed where . necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by Heimstaden.  . The carrying amount of equity-accounted investments is tested for impairment if . objective evidence of impairment exists. The net investment is tested as one single . asset under IAS 36, by comparing its carrying amount to the recoverable amount. . Recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell."
99,0.2,"When Heimstaden ceases equity accounting for an investment because of a loss . joint control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured . to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. . This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent-. ly accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial . asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive . income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if Heimstaden had directly . disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously . recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.If the . ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or . significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts . previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit  . or loss where appropriate."

The functional currency is the . currency used in the primary economic environments where the companies . conduct their operations. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are . translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of . the reporting period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are recognised at . historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. . Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value are translated . into the functional currency at the rate prevailing on the date of fair value . measurement."
99,0.12,"Assets and liabilities in foreign operations are translated to Swedish kronor at the . exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Income and expenses . in a foreign operation are translated into Swedish kronor at an average rate that . represents an approximation of the prevailing exchange rates at the date of each . transaction. The currency effect connected to cross currency swaps is recognised . in the line item Net foreign exchange gains (losses), the currency effect on loans in . foreign currency and the corresponding economic hedge is thus reported on the . same line in the statement of profit and loss."

The amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations clarify that to be considered a . business, an integrated set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an . input and a substantive process that, together, significantly contribute to the ability . to create output.

100,0.6551724137931035,"IFRS 16 Leasing (covid-19). One effect of the covid-19 pandemic is that the IASB published a temporary . amendment to IFRS 16 in May, due to the IASB’s view that revaluation of rent . discounts in accordance with IFRS 16 during the ongoing pandemic can be . administratively difficult and expensive for lessees."
100,0.13793103448275862,"The temporary relief means that for reducing rent payments, which are received as . a direct result of covid-19, lessees do not have to make new calculations of . reported leasing debt and reported right of use but can instead handle the change . as if it did not constitute a change in the leasing agreement. This means that in  . cases where there is an unconditional forgiveness of the debt, the debt is reduced . at that time. If the relief is applied, this must be stated in the financial report. The . relief refers to reduced rental payments with a due date of 30 June 2021 or earlier. . Heimstaden has, as of the end of 2020, not recognised any rent reductions."

The IASB proposed that IAS 1 be supplement-. ed with guidance to help companies understand what makes an accounting . principle material; information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could . reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general . purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, . which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.

Payment flows in several different types of financial agreements and leasing . agreements are often based on reference interest rates. Instruments with  . variable interest rates (short interest-bearing periods) such as bonds, corporate . loans and interest rate swaps are often based on an IBOR (interbank offered rate) . reference rate. Changes in reference interest rates give rise to a number of . consequences in the accounts, which the IASB has addressed in a “two . stepprocess” with changes in IAS 39, IFRS 7, and IFRS 9. The first phase of . changes is intended to address undesirable consequences that may arise in the . interim while the reform is underway. These changes took effect on 1 January 2020."

119,0.84,"• The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold . financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows . And"
119,0.88,"• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash . flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount . outstanding."
119,0.16,"Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective . interest method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised  . in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired."
119,0.4,"Since Heimstaden’s financial assets (rent and other trade receivables, other . receivables, cash and short-term deposits) meet these conditions, they are . subsequently measured at amortised cost."
119,0.32,"A financial asset is primarily derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows . from the asset have expired or when Heimstaden has transferred its rights to . receive cash flows from the asset and either Heimstaden has transferred . substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or Heimstaden has neither . transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has . transferred control of the asset."
119,0.68,"Impairment. Heimstaden recognises an allowance for expected credit losses. For all debt . instrument except those held at fair value through profit or loss."
119,0.08,"Expected credit losses are based on the difference between the contractual cash . flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that Heimstaden . expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest . rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral . held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms."
119,0.12,"The valuation of expected credit losses is based on various methods. Other . receivables and assets that are not under the scope of simplified method (see Note"
119,0.2,"A 6  Trade receivables), are impaired in accordance with a rating-based method . using external credit rating. In accordance with the general method, the financial . assets covered by provisions for expected credit losses are cash and cash . equivalents, other non-current receivables and other receivables."
119,0.28,"Expected credit losses are valued at the product of probability of default, loss given . default and the exposure in the event of default. Heimstaden has defined default  . as when payment of the claim is overdue by 90 days or more, or if other factors . indicate that payment is in default. For assets and receivables with deteriorated . credit exposure, an individual assessment is made, taking into account historical, . current and forward-looking data. The assessment of whether there is a significant . increase in credit risk at the statement of financial position date for a receivable or . asset is based on whether payment is overdue by 30 days or more, or if significant . deterioration of rating occurs, entailing a rating below investment grade. In cases . where the amounts are not deemed insignificant, a provision is made for expected . credit losses for these financial instruments too. The valuation of expected credit . losses takes into account any collateral and other credit enhancements in the form . of guarantees."
119,0.44,"Heimstaden considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are . 90 days past due. However, in certain cases, Heimstaden may also consider a . financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that . Heimstaden is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before . taking into account any credit enhancements held by Heimstaden. A financial asset . is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual . cash flows."

RFR 2 means that the Parent Company’s Annual Report for  . the legal entity shall apply all IFRS and statements adopted by the EU as far as . possible within the framework of the Annual Accounts Act and with regard to  . the relationship between accounting and taxation. The standard indicates what . exceptions from, and additions to, IFRS are to be made."

135,0.4,"Investments in Group companies. Investments in Group companies are recognised at acquisition value less . deductions for any impairments. The acquisition value includes acquisition-related . costs and any contingent consideration. When there are indications that . participations in Group companies have decreased in value, the recoverable . amount is calculated. If this is lower than the carrying amount, the investment is . impaired. Impairment is recognised under the item “Profit from investments in . Group companies”."
135,0.34285714285714286,"Financial instruments. Due to the connection between accounting and taxation, the rules regarding . financial instruments in accordance with IFRS 9 are not applied in the Parent . Company as a legal entity, and the Parent Company applies instead the cost . method in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. Accordingly, in the Parent . Company, financial non-current assets are valued at cost and financial current . assets in accordance with the principle of lowest value, applying impairment for . expected loan losses in accordance with IFRS 9 regarding assets that are debt . instruments. For other financial assets, impairment is based on market value. . Derivative instruments with negative fair value are reported as a liability at the . negative fair value with changes in value being recognised in the Statement of . Comprehensive Income."
135,0.11428571428571428,"The Parent Company applies the exemption to not value financial guarantee . agreements benefiting subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures in . accordance with the rules in IFRS 9, applying instead the valuation principles in . accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets."

The Parent Company applies the same impairment method as the Group for . expected credit losses on current and non-current receivables from subsi diaries. . The Parent Company judges that the subsidiaries currently have similar risk profiles . and assessments are performed on a collective basis for similar transactions.  . As of the Statement of Financial Position date, no material increase in credit risk . has been deemed to prevail for any intra-Group receivables, such assessment is . based on whether payment is 30 days late or more. The Parent Company’s . receivables from its subsidiaries are subordinated external lenders’ claims, for . which the subsidiary’s properties have been pledged as collateral. The Parent . Company’s expected loss in the event of default takes into account the average of . the subsidiaries’ loan-to-value ratios and their expected market value in the event . of a forced sale. Based on the Parent Company’s assessments in accordance with . the aforementioned method, taking other known information and forward-looking . factors into account, it is estimated that expected loan losses will not be significant . and no provision has therefore been reported."

Heimstaden’s greenhouse gas emissions increased due to many new acquisitions during 2020. Greenhouse gas emissions in Scope 1 come from natural . gas and oil for heating. Scope 2 covers district heating and consumption of electricity in the properties. As we have most of our properties in the Czech Republic and Sweden, those . countries account for most of the greenhouse gas emissions. The calculations have been performed in accordance with the GHG protocol, applying the financial control approach. For the . year 2020, emission factors from 2019 are used and have been obtained from the relevant energy supplier. Gases included in the calculations are mostly CO2, but can also include CH4, N2O . and refrigerants used in the production of district heating. Compared to last year, the CO² emissions per square metre increased due to the acquisition of the Czech portfolio, where the en-. ergy mix is   dominated by fossil fuels. The denominator consists of the lettable area in the properties where Heimstaden signs the energy agreement and the numerator consists of green-. house gas emissions during a whole year. Properties that lack data for an entire year are excluded from the intensity figures."
