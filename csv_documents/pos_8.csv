5,0.5454545454545454,"The extraordinary times we are living through push us every day  . to find new ways to reposition ourselves in a global economy  . focused on sustainability. We are leveraging our consolidated  . expertise of a world-scale, technology-driven engineering and . contracting company to open our long-term vision of a new . low-carbon economy. With this in mind, our multiple role as . technologists, contractors and entrepreneurs can work as an . accelerating factor for a concrete energy transition. We want . to ride this transformative phase using more and more sus-. tainability as a strategic lever to drive our business today. . That’s the new role for companies in such a challenging lan-. dascape and that’s why an entrepreneurial attitude is . needed."

Globally, we work through joint platforms to . make our actions more powerful. The 17 Sustainable Develop-. ment Goals and the 10 principles underlying the UN Global . Compact become a shared vocabulary between internation-. al bodies, the private sector, communities and public opinion, . for talking about common responsibility and a common future."

6,1.0,"LETTER FROM THE CEO"
6,0.28571428571428575,"Dear Stakeholders,"
6,0.42857142857142855,"2019 was the end of a very intense decade for sustainability  . globally. Many changes have taken place in the last 10 years, both . in terms of greater awareness of public opinion and of visible  . effects deriving from an uncontrolled use of natural resources, . from irresponsible production systems and from changes in . the consumption of industrial products. The global changes, . occurring particularly and to an unprecedented extent in  . natural phenomena, have woken everyone up, at all levels, . urging them to find new solutions for a form of economic de-. velopment for today that doesn’t threaten the environment . and social equality tomorrow. In the last decade our role as an in-. dustrial player in the hydrocarbon sector gradually changed. We . have kept working in our core business as a market leader with . excellent financial performance, proven once again in 2019 with . revenues of 3.3 billion euro. But at the same time, we strive to find . new ways to meet the unstoppable transition toward a different . energy mix and the search for new feedstocks to be processed at . industrial level. Our long experience and respected expertise . in hydrocarbon processing gave us the keys to open new . doors. The Green Acceleration Project set up by our Group is . our way to move further through this changing phase and step . into the fourth industrial revolution, with our focus on industri-. alizing sustainability. This isn’t a white paper, starting from . scratch. We are leveraging our solid expertise in building large . plants and our technological aptitude, in order to speed up . innovation when working on the frontiers of green chemistry, . circular economy and industrial carbon footprint reduction. . Our long-term commitment to a lower environmental impact, . led us at the end of 2019 to issue an ESG-linked Schuldschein . loan, a concrete pledge to achieve the Group’s CO2 emission . reduction targets. The financial community has become more and . more demanding, clients need urgent technical solutions to cut . the environmental impact of their products, stakeholders are more . aware and active than ever, and we are ready to contribute to this . new industrial era by taking our passion for “joining the dots” even . further. Innovation does not mean discovering new solutions; it . means joining existing solutions in new ways to serve new needs. . This is at the heart of the only possible and realistic energy transi-. tion. The next decade, leading up to 2030, will be crucial. Our . Group has set the Sustainable Development Goals as its compass . in reaching that milestone, convinced that only joint action, at a . global level, can really make positive change happen, and even . more convinced that, as an industrial player, our Group has a . greater responsibility to make those changes possible by unleash-. ing the potential of our expertise."

21,0.7234042553191489,"The energy transition is driving . both producers and customers to . rethink their future needs and . what kinds of products and solu-. tions will be required to enable a . sustainable future in terms of . emissions waste and economics. . The scale and complexity of the . shift required are huge, but it will . be driven by asset owners increas-. ingly moving capital employed . from traditional, legacy activities . to  new,  greener  assets  and  . by customers placing a premium . on  sustainable  products  and . consumption."
21,0.851063829787234,"Increasing the pres-. sure to address sus-. tainability issues for . the core business . and to reduce CO2 . emissions from leg-. acy assets is creat-. ing new opportuni-. ties for traditional . players and new en-. trants, opening up . new markets. Envi-. ronmental remedia-. tion, renewable en-. ergy, recycling, and . cleaner  fuels . are . just a few examples . of the new business . areas. As plastics . recycled from waste increase in . volumes for instance, oil required . as feedstock for the plastic indus-. try will significantly reduce, shift-. ing profit pool from the hydro-. carbon industry to new segments . of the value chain (e.g. waste col-. lection and management, recy-. cling, petrochemicals)."

21,0.9361702127659575,"Circularity implies a . process of restora-. tion and regenera-. tion, in which mate-. rials constantly flow . around  a  ‘closed . loop’ system, rather . than  being  used . once and then dis-. carded; this means . a need to develop . and scale technolo-. gies for mechanical . and chemical recy-. cling, to adapt cur-. rent industrial pro-. cesses to use new . circular  feedstock . deriving from waste, . for the production of new, “circu-. lar” chemicals, or fuels, from . waste."
21,0.6808510638297872,"Let’s take biofuels, which . have a vital role, together . with electric and CNG vehi-. cles, in tackling decarboni-. zation in the transport sec-. tor.

22,0.35,"We are also networking and study-. ing new models for an open inno-. vation and for a reshaping of indus-. trial landscapes. The new shape of . industry will include a much greater . rate of collaboration across large-. scale and distributed green compa-. nies. Therefore, the site of the near . future will likely comprise – in a dis-. tributed or integrated logic – oil re-. fining, petrochemicals production, . renewable power generation, bio . feedstock and fuel production, . waste collection and recycling, hy-. drogen production."
22,0.7,"In fact, two green industrial busi-. ness models will emerge:"
22,0.9,"BROWNFIELD INTEGRATED . BUSINESS MODEL"
22,0.3,"in which green technology units . will be integrated into industrial . clusters to leverage existing infra-. structure (storage, logistics) and . assets (refinery conversion units). . This solution will be typically pre-. ferred in large industrial clusters . contexts where large feedstock . volumes are needed or available. . Examples  of  technologies  are . waste-to-methanol, waste-to-fuel, . hydrogen production, waste plastic . to chemicals. This model offers a . great solution for green technolo-. gy adoption to exploit advantages . of scale and costs while maintain-. ing flexibility and choice."
22,0.6,"DISTRIBUTED BUSINESS . MODEL. where green technology / plants . will be of small or medium size . and distributed around the country. . The aim is to be in proximity to the . feedstock and reduce inbound . logistics costs and complexity. Re-. newable fuel is a good example of . the potential for distributed busi-. ness: to reduce the biomass logisti-. cal constraints driven by high vol-. umes,  companies  decentralize . biomass processing locally. Bio-. mass is then transported in liquid . status, which considerably reduces . both costs and complexity, and . then stored and transformed into . fuel at existing refineries, thus"
22,0.45,"leveraging existing assets and re-. ducing the capex needed for the . conversion (this solution typically . requires a retrofitting of the FCC to . enable co-processing)."
22,0.5,"In both models, distributed and in-. tegrated, given the innovative as-. pect of both the business model . and the technology, there is a com-. mon trend of developing partner-. ships for joint development be-. tween the different actors in the . value chain, to socialize costs and . risks, but also to develop the right . conditions to test the first pilots. In-. deed, there is a need to both secure . the intake of the new feedstock . (waste, organic biomass) and  . ensure a stable offtake from the . market. Therefore, the ability to de-. velop partnerships between tech-. nology providers, industrial / ener-. gy companies, and feedstock . management companies (be it . waste or agricultural biomass) is a . key success factor in developing . green industry."
22,0.55,"With a view to accelerating techno-. logical innovation in the energy . transition, Maire Tecnimont is dedi-. cating great attention, through . NextChem, to developing techno-. logical solutions for improving . waste recovery technologies in the . circular economy, developing pro-. cesses for the use of biological . components as feedstock and inno-. vations to reduce greenhouse emis-. sions  in  traditional  industrial . processes."
22,0.25,"NextChem is moving towards a . more integrated approach where it . acts as project developer of more . articulated solutions. It orchestrates . the work of the different players, be . they industrial companies or pro-. ducers, waste managers or suppli-. ers, government authorities or reg-. ulators, or even investors. As such, .

22,0.85,"grey hydrogen, which is . produced from natural gas . through  steam  methane  . reforming, through a process . that  produces  CO2 . concurrently;"
22,0.8,"blue hydrogen, a thermal . treatment of methane to pro-. duce carbon and gaseous hy-. drogen, but no CO2;"
22,0.4,"green hydrogen, produced . from electricity and water . through electrolysis. If renew-. able electricity is used, zero . emissions are generated.. Grey hydrogen is the main . solution in a low-carbon-. price scenario. However, to . sustain global decarboniza-. tion trends, blue and green . hydrogen are expected to . grow significantly. As of 2017, . the total hydrogen market . was estimated at between . ~$115 billion and $130 billion, . with an expected compound . annual growth rate (from . 2017 to 2025) in the range of . ~6-7%, coming in 2025 to a . terminal value of ~$200 bil-. lion7. Looking at practical ap-. plications, the largest hydro-. gen demand arises from the . chemical industry (~65% of . total consumption). However, . in view of the energy transi-. tion and sustainability, poten-. tial application could be ex-. tended to other industrial . scopes such as refineries and . heavy industry, like steel, or . high energy-consuming pro-. cesses, like glass. We are . moving in this direction with . several projects related to the . production of hydrogen (and . other chemicals) from waste, . a really innovative challenge . which solves two key prob-. lems: waste recovery on one . hand, and process decarbon-. ization on the other."
