1,0.125,"Scenarios. This report contains data and analyses from Shell’s new. Sky Scenario. Unlike Shell’s previously published. Mountains and Oceans exploratory scenarios, the Sky. Scenario is based on the assumption that society. reaches the Paris Agreement’s goal of holding the rise in. global average temperatures this century to well below. two degrees Celsius (2°C) above pre-industrial levels.. Unlike Shell’s Mountains and Oceans scenarios which. unfolded in an open-ended way based upon plausible. assumptions and quantifications, the Sky Scenario was. specifically designed to reach the Paris Agreement’s. goal in a technically possible manner. These scenarios. are a part of an ongoing process used in Shell for over. 40 years to challenge executives’ perspectives on the. future business environment. They are designed to. stretch management to consider even events that may. only be remotely possible. Scenarios, therefore, are not. intended to be predictions of likely future events or"
1,0.25,"outcomes and investors should not rely on them when. making an investment decision with regard to Royal. Dutch Shell plc securities."
1,0.0625,"Additionally, it is important to note that Shell’s existing. portfolio has been decades in development. While we. believe our portfolio is resilient under a wide range of. outlooks, including the IEA’s 450 scenario (World Energy. Outlook 2016), it includes assets across a spectrum of. energy intensities including some with above-average. intensity. While we seek to enhance our operations’. average energy intensity through both the development. of new projects and divestments, we have no immediate. plans to move to a net-zero emissions portfolio over our. investment horizon of 10-20 years. Although we have no. immediate plans to move to a net-zero emissions portfolio,. in November of 2017, we announced our ambition to. reduce our Net Carbon Footprint in accordance with. society’s implementation of the Paris Agreement’s goal of. holding global average temperature to well below 2°C. above pre industrial levels. Accordingly, assuming society. aligns itself with the Paris Agreement’s goals, we aim to. reduce our Net Carbon Footprint, which includes not only. our direct and indirect carbon emissions, associated with. producing the energy products which we sell, but also our. customers’ emissions from their use of the energy products. that we sell, by around 20% in 2035 and by around 50%. in 2050."
2,0.41666666666666663,"Welcome to Shell's Sustainability Report for 2018."
2,0.9166666666666667,"In my five years in this role I have worked to drive change. for Shell and the industry as a whole. Change that puts. us in a strong position to help society meet increasing. energy demand while providing products with a lower. carbon footprint."
2,0.25,"Yet one area remains consistently essential to the way. Shell does business. That is sustainability. We continue to. put three things at the heart of our approach."
2,0.5,"First, we aim to run a safe, responsible and profitable. business. That means getting the basics right. One basic. is doing no harm. For our industry, that means operating. safely without hurting people or the environment.. However, in 2018, there were two fatalities at Shell. locations – one person died at a refinery in Germany. and another at an onshore well in the USA. Every life lost. is unacceptable. We must all work safely. In Nigeria, for. example, a country that presents complex operating. challenges, Shell companies there have sometimes. struggled. In Groningen, in the Netherlands, we continue. to work with others, including the government, to help. people affected by earthquakes linked to our gas. production activities. When we do not live up to the. standards society expects, we must learn and repair any. related damage."
2,0.5833333333333334,"We have also reflected deeply on the terrible road. tanker incident in Pakistan in 2017. The tragedy, which. was outside the scope of Shell’s operational control,. underscored the need to consider how we can. encourage effective health and safety standards in. operations not under our control. Shell Pakistan Limited is. currently contributing to long-term relief efforts for the. families affected. Sadly, in October 2018 there was. another roll-over incident in Pakistan involving a customer. tanker, which resulted in the death of the relief driver and. a spill. Events like these are a stark reminder that we must. never forget the role that safety plays in our lives. every day."
2,0.33333333333333337,"Second, to deliver energy products that people need. and want – and do this responsibly to help shape a more. sustainable energy future. People rely on the energy we. produce to live their lives, in their homes and businesses,. and for transport. We must be responsible stewards for. these energy products. This means taking action on the. greenhouse gas emissions associated with our energy. products. Only by making relevant products responsibly. can we be in business sustainably."
2,0.75,"Third, to make a positive contribution to society. This. means paying taxes, boosting local economies and. developing talent, as well as investing in education to. inspire new generations of people with innovative ideas.. It is an effort that also includes helping to achieve. universal access to clean, affordable energy, one of the. UN’s 17 sustainable development goals. Part of this effort. is the ambition we announced in 2018: to provide a. reliable electricity supply to 100 million people in the. developing world by 2030. We continue to work on. developing a longer-term strategy to achieve. this ambition."
2,0.16666666666666669,"This approach to sustainability provides the deep. foundations we need to support our business strategy: to. become – and remain – a world-class investment, to. thrive through the transition to lower-carbon energy and. to maintain a strong societal licence to operate."
2,0.8333333333333333,"The 2018 Sustainability Report, our 22nd such report,. shows real action in the three parts of our approach to. sustainability. It also includes details of our social, safety. and environmental performance in 2018. Once again, I. am grateful for the valuable input of the independent. Report Review Panel, who help us provide more. balanced, relevant and responsive reporting. As a. founding member of the UN Global Compact, we also. continue to support its corporate governance principles. on human rights, environmental protection, anti-corruption. and better labour practices."
2,0.6666666666666667,"This report shows much progress. But I believe we can do. better. We must do the right thing on climate change,. which means helping to reduce the environmental impact. that comes with making our energy products."

3,0.33333333333333337,"If society is to meet the aims of the Paris Agreement, there. is a lot of work to do to cut global greenhouse gas. emissions while meeting rising demand for energy."
3,0.2222222222222222,"Shell’s ambition is to reduce the Net Carbon Footprint of. the energy products we sell by around half by the middle. of the century in step with society as it moves towards. meeting the aims of Paris. We were the first international. oil and gas company to set an ambition using a measure. which includes our customers' emissions when they use. the energy products we sell, as well as emissions from our. operations and supply chains that bring these products to. market. This also includes those emissions generated by. third parties who supply energy and finished products to. us. In 2018, we also announced we would set short-term. Net Carbon Footprint targets. We linked a Net Carbon. Footprint target and other measures to our executive. remuneration starting in 2019, one year earlier than. planned. To achieve our 2050 ambition, we will adapt. and evolve over time the range of products we offer in. line with our customers’ needs, increase the lower and. zero emission energy products we offer, including natural. gas, biofuels and renewable power."
3,1.0,"We will also be working increasingly with nature, such as. forests and wetlands, and progressing carbon capture. and storage to create sinks for those emissions that are. hard to avoid."
3,0.5555555555555556,"And we are working on making our own operations more. efficient. In our natural gas production and processing,. this means limiting leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse. gas. To do this, in 2018 we launched a drive to improve. the data we gather on our own operational methane. leaks and set a methane intensity target. We are also. finding better ways to detect and repair methane leaks in. our operations."
3,0.7777777777777777,"The Net Carbon Footprint ambition will help ensure our. relevance and resilience in the energy system of the. future, which is crucial to being a world-class investment. over the long term."
3,0.4444444444444444,"In this report you will find details of the actions we are. taking to operate safely, to respect the environment and. to work closely with communities. There is detail on our. drive to build on our solid financial foundations guided by. our business strategy, which will help us navigate through. all the change to come."
3,0.6666666666666667,"In a time of constant change, keeping sustainability as the. consistent bedrock of our approach to doing business is. not only right for society. It will be critically important to. Shell’s success."

8,0.8333333333333333,"REPORT REVIEW PANEL STATEMENT"
8,0.5555555555555556,"The Report Review Panel issues the following. independent statement on Shell's 2018. Sustainability Report:"
8,0.2777777777777778,"We commend Shell on its continued commitment to. transparency and progress on its most material. sustainability impacts. We have had the opportunity. to review two drafts of the 2018 Sustainability Report. and provide feedback to Shell through conference. calls and in writing. Shell has responded to our. questions and suggestions. We have developed this. statement independently following our review."
8,0.4444444444444444,"We appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback. and recommendations for further improving Shell’s. sustainability reporting. In line with the scope of our. review, our feedback focuses on the quality of Shell’s. sustainability reporting rather than its. sustainability performance."
8,0.5,"We are pleased to see many of our. recommendations on the 2017 Sustainability Report. reflected in this report. For example, Shell has. elevated its disclosure on social issues with a more. comprehensive human rights section that brings. together updates on its human rights. priorities. Similarly, Shell included more information on. its approach to the UN's sustainable development. goals, although there remains an opportunity for the. company to use the goals to more clearly frame. strategic priorities, such as increasing access to. electricity and to connect related steps Shell is taking. to meet its objectives. Independent comments from. external stakeholders throughout this report provide a. more balanced view of Shell’s strengths. and challenges."
8,0.2222222222222222,"We are encouraged by the expanded information. about Shell’s approach to managing water risk and. would like to see additional disclosure of targets and. other measures Shell uses to minimise risks of adverse. impacts at the project level. The inclusion of Shell’s. approach to plastics in this report is equally. important. For the next report, we see an opportunity. to discuss Shell’s role in addressing the global. challenge of ocean plastics. We welcome Shell’s. continuing efforts to disclose its approach to public. policy issues as we see responsible engagement as a. key sustainability priority for the energy sector."
8,0.16666666666666669,"Building on its experience and leadership in. sustainability reporting, we believe that for 2019,. Shell has an opportunity for a transformative evolution. of its approach to sustainability reporting. While the. wide range of topics covered in detail shows. leadership in sustainability reporting, this. comprehensiveness also presents challenges: for. readers to focus on content most relevant to them and. for the company to articulate its strategic priorities. and the measurement of progress against them in the. most effective way. In the future, Shell could focus on. integrating its strategic priorities under a clearly. articulated sustainability strategy. This would also. allow Shell to produce a more succinct report with. the opportunity for more in-depth discussions and. precise reporting on progress on strategic priorities."
8,0.38888888888888884,"We would like to thank Shell for the opportunity to. share our feedback here and throughout the drafting. process and we look forward to the next evolution in. Shell’s sustainability reporting."

Our. strategy is to strengthen our position as a leading energy. company by providing oil, gas and low-carbon energy. as the world’s energy system transforms. Safety and. social responsibility are fundamental to our business. approach. Shell will only succeed by working. collaboratively with customers, governments, business. partners, investors and other stakeholders."
9,0.16666666666666669,"Our strategy is founded on our outlook for the energy. sector and the chance to grasp the opportunities arising. from the substantial changes in the world around us. The. rising standard of living of a growing global population is. likely to continue to drive demand for energy, including. oil and gas, for years to come. At the same time,. technology changes and the need to tackle climate. change means there is a transition under way to a lower-. carbon energy system with increasing customer choice.. We recognise that the pace and specific path. forward are uncertain and so require agile decision-. making."
9,0.5,"STRATEGIC AMBITIONS. Against this backdrop, we have the following strategic. ambitions to guide us in pursuing our purpose:"
9,0.43333333333333335,"▪ to provide a world-class investment case. This involves. growing free cash flow and increasing returns, all built. upon a strong financial framework and resilient. portfolio;"
9,0.4,"▪ to thrive in the energy transition by responding to. society’s desire for more and cleaner, convenient and. competitive energy; and"
9,0.4666666666666666,"▪ to sustain a strong societal licence to operate and. make a positive contribution to society through our. activities."
9,0.1,"The execution of our strategy is founded on becoming a. more customer-centric and simpler organisation, focused. on growing returns and free cash flow. By investing in. competitive projects, driving down costs and selling non-. core businesses, we are continuously reshaping our. portfolio to become more resilient and focused."
9,0.13333333333333333,"Our ability to achieve our strategic ambitions depends. on how we respond to competitive forces. We. continuously assess the external environment – the. markets as well as the underlying economic, political,. social and environmental drivers that shape them – to. evaluate changes in competitive forces and business. models. We use multiple future scenarios to assess the. resilience of our strategy. We undertake regular reviews. of the markets we operate in and analyse trends and. uncertainties, as well as our traditional and non-. traditional competitors’ strengths and weaknesses, to. understand our competitive position. We maintain. business strategies and plans that focus on actions and. capabilities to create and sustain competitive advantage.. We maintain a risk management framework that. regularly assesses our response to, and risk appetite for,. identified risk factors."
9,0.26666666666666666,"Our Executive Directors’ remuneration is linked to the. successful delivery of our strategy, based on. performance indicators that are aligned with shareholder. interests. Long-term incentives form the majority of the. Executive Directors’ remuneration for above-target. performance. Our Long-term Incentive Plan includes cash. generation, capital discipline and value created. for shareholders."

10,0.2777777777777778,"DELIVERING ON OUR STRATEGY. We refreshed our business strategy in 2016, not long. after completing the acquisition of BG, which added. significantly to our portfolio in liquefied natural gas. (LNG) worldwide as well as deep-water oil and gas. production in Brazil. As part of the strategy, we also. created a New Energies business to continue to explore. investment opportunities in areas including new fuels for. transport, such as advanced biofuels, hydrogen and. charging for battery-electric vehicles; and power,. including from low-carbon sources such as wind and. solar, as well as natural gas. In 2017, we continued to. reshape Shell as a world-class investment case that could. thrive in the energy transition with a strong licence to. operate; selling assets not central to our strategy such as. our partial divestment of oil sands mines and. discontinuing frontier exploration in Arctic waters, while. growing free cash flow and reducing debt."
10,0.4444444444444444,"We have continued to make progress in 2018 to deliver. a world-class investment. We must maintain our focus. and build on the success of our divestment goals,. reduction of net debt, the start of share buy-backs and. the growth in free cash flow."
10,0.2222222222222222,"During the same period, we continued to position. ourselves as a leader among peers in the transition to a. lower-carbon future. We expanded our New Energies. business and announced a methane emissions intensity. target for our oil and gas assets. We worked with the. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (see. Greenhouse gas emissions) and set our ambition to. reduce the Net Carbon Footprint of the energy products. we sell by around half by the middle of the century and. in step with society as it moves towards meeting. the goals of the Paris Agreement."
10,0.16666666666666669,"In 2018, we committed to operationalise our ambition of. around 50% Net Carbon Footprint reduction by 2050,. through the setting of short-term targets linked to. executive remuneration. This commitment was made in a. joint statement developed with institutional investors on. behalf of Climate Action 100+, an initiative led by. investors with more than $32 trillion in assets under. management. Further, in early 2019, as part of our. transparency efforts within remuneration, we have. published our CEO Pay Ratio, in line with new legislation.. Although this is not required until 2020, we were keen to. publish this information early. For full details, please see. our Directors’ Remuneration Report in our Annual Report."
10,0.5,"We maintained our focus on running a safe, responsible. and profitable business. For example, in 2018 we. announced our decision to build an LNG facility in British. Columbia, Canada. The project was planned and. designed by working closely with local communities, First. Nations and governments to ensure sustainable. development was considered in every aspect of the. project. For example, the project has been designed to. achieve the lowest carbon intensity of any LNG project. in operation today, partly aided by the use. of hydropower."
10,0.38888888888888884,"Finally, we announced our ambition to provide a reliable. electricity supply to 100 million people in the developing. world by 2030 at the One Young World conference in. The Hague, the Netherlands (see Access to energy). We. continue to work on developing a longer-term strategy to. achieve this ambition."

Our commitment to safety, the environment and. communities plays an important role in how we plan,. design and operate our projects and facilities. We. conduct detailed environmental, social and health impact. assessments for every major project."

12,0.3157894736842105,"When we invest in projects, we aim to balance the short-. and long-term interests of our business. For investment. decisions, we consider the economic, social, ethical and. environmental risks and opportunities as well as the. political and technical risks. The LNG Canada joint. venture and Shell Canada's Groundbirch asset in British. Columbia are examples of how we embed sustainability. in our projects (see Delivering natural gas in Canada)."
12,0.368421052631579,"Managing risks to people and the environment is. essential to delivering a successful project. The mandatory. requirements in our Health, Safety, Security, Environment. and Social Performance (HSSE&SP) Control Framework. help to ensure our projects and assets are safe."
12,0.631578947368421,"As part of the HSSE&SP Control Framework, we require. projects and assets that produce more than 50,000. tonnes of greenhouse gases per year to have a. greenhouse gas and energy management plan in place. (see Energy efficiency in our operations). For projects, our. planning process helps to guide our decisions on which. technology to use, including whether carbon capture and. storage should be considered, and whether to move. ahead with the project."
12,0.4210526315789474,"For example, applying the framework at our Gorek gas. platform in Malaysia highlighted that solar panels could. be used as one source for the power supply. At our. Pearl gas-to-liquids plant in Qatar, we are using a fuel by-. product of the process to power the plant. This fuel had. previously been flared, or burned off. Using it in this way. has helped reduce our overall emissions by 550,000. tonnes of CO2 on a yearly basis."
12,0.5789473684210527,"We engage with communities and other stakeholders as. part of our impact assessment process to explain the. project, consider suggestions and discuss possible ways. to address any concerns. In addition to complying with. relevant social and environmental regulations and align. with international standards, including those from the.

These steps include starting to introduce a. single global asset management system to be adopted. by Shell-operated facilities and some non-operated. ventures. The system provides asset managers with an. overview of steps they should take for safe and efficient. management of facilities. For example, it includes. expectations related to asset equipment care,. maintenance, learning from incidents and conducting. assurance. Having a single system is expected to help.

82,0.2,"[A] Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) comprise carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride. The data are calculated using. locally regulated methods where they exist. Where there is no locally regulated method, the data are calculated using the 2009 API Compendium, which is the recognised industry standard under the. GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. There are inherent limitations to the accuracy of such data. Oil and gas industry guidelines (IPIECA/API/IOGP) indicate that several. sources of uncertainty can contribute to the overall uncertainty of a corporate emissions inventory. We have estimated the overall uncertainty of our direct GHG emissions to be around 2%. 2015-2018. emissions are calculated using Global Warming Potential factors from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report. Data for prior years were calculated using Global Warming Potential factors from the IPCC’s. Second Assessment Report.. [B] These emissions were calculated using the market-based method in line with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.. [C] The term upstream in this context includes assets and activities from our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses.. [D] Nigeria includes SPDC onshore operations (0.5 million tonnes flared in 2018) and SNEPCo offshore operations (0.3 million tonnes flared in 2018).. [E] Flaring from the Majnoon field in Iraq and from Malaysia amounted to 0.4 and 0.1 million tonnes of hydrocarbons respectively in 2018.. [F] Methodology was updated in 2012. Data for prior years are not directly comparable.. [G] Data are indexed to 2002, based on Solomon Associates Energy Intensity Index 2006 methodology.. [H] All spill volumes and numbers are for spills of more than 100 kilograms. Due to the rounding of numbers, spill volumes for Nigeria and the rest of the world might not add up to the exact total volume. of spills.. [I] As of the end of March 2019, there was 1 spill under investigation in Nigeria that may result in adjustments.. [J] All sabotage- and theft-related spills have occurred in Nigeria except in 2016 (0.001 thousand tonnes) and 2015 (0.005 thousand tonnes).. [K] Nigeria includes SPDC onshore operations and SNEPCo offshore operations. A single spill at the Bonga field offshore Nigeria amounted to 4.8 thousand tonnes in 2011.. [L] Nigeria includes SPDC onshore operations (15 operational spills in 2018) and SNEPCo offshore operations (0 operational spills in 2018).. [M] 2017 data reflect 4 spills caused by Hurricane Harvey in the USA.. [N] Freshwater figures do not include once-through cooling water.. [O] In 2018, we sent waste off-site for recycling or reuse, or sold around 400 thousand tonnes of material that would otherwise have been disposed of as waste.. n/c = not calculated."
