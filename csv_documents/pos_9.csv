2,0.5,"Dear Reader,"
2,0.6,"Sustainability is reflected in many aspects of Faber-Castell’s business activities. With a history . spanning almost 260 years, the company can look back on a multitude of visionary and for-. ward-thinking leaders. Alongside Lothar von Faber, who was already dedicated to social commit-. ment in the middle of the 19th century, Count Anton-Wolfgang von Faber-Castell also led his com-. pany prospective into the future. He acted with conviction and set the right course for a sustainable . company that is aware of its social and environmental responsibility. In cooperation with the ninth . generation of the family, our Corporate Essentials, the company’s guiding principles, have now been . improved to meet future requirements. They explain what we stand for, what we want to achieve, . and which values underlie our actions."
2,0.2,"The Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations for a sustainable global community . include topics which also form the basis of Faber-Castell’s corporate activities (page 26f and 30f)."
2,0.3,"We particularly focus on obtaining our most important raw material – the wood for our pencils – . from socially and environmentally sustainable sources. As a pioneer in the industry, Faber-Castell . launched our forestry project in Prata, south-east Brazil, as early as the beginning of the 1980s.  . Our company-owned, FSC®-certified forests absorb 900,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the . atmosphere. They serve not only as a source of raw materials for our largest plant in Brazil, but  . also offset the carbon footprint of our production facilities worldwide (page 14f)."
2,0.4,"We are also pushing the use of renewable energies, which already account for 63 percent of the . Group’s energy consumption. Our sites in Brazil and Austria already draw their electricity entirely . from these sources (page 22). At our headquarters in Stein, our own hydroelectric power plant .  produces electricity that drives our production process (page 22) and from 2020 we will obtain 100 . percent of our purchased electricity from renewable sources. We are also developing a strategy to .  reduce or substitute plastics in our packaging and products."
2,0.8,"The Sustainability Fact Sheet 2019 provides information on the current development status of our . global commitment, reports on improvements achieved and addresses the challenges we face. We . wish to have an active dialogue with you and invite you to accompany and support us on our journey. . Please send us any feedback at sustainability@faber-castell.com. We look forward to hearing from . you!"

Those dynamics present opportunities for Faber-Castell. Haptic experiences are emerging as a backlash . while interest in creative abilities is growing. In 2018, Faber-Castell created its “Corporate Essentials”, a mission . statement building around its core brand values. This new statement focuses more on the core ideas of creativity . and customer experience. As a “life companion”, Faber-Castell wants to promote and enable creativity from young . to old ages and inspire its customers to experience creativity with innovative products."

11,0.6,"By implementing different types of certification and establishing .  management systems, Faber-Castell ensures that quality, sustainability . and social standards are maintained at a global level.. The initial certification for ISO 9001 (Quality Management) and ISO . 14001 (Environmental Management) began in 1997 and was completed . in 2011 for all production sites. All sites are audited and certified .  according to the revised standard from 2015. Cosmetics’ new North . American plant in Elgin, USA, which opened in March 2019, received . ISO certification in May 2019."
11,0.3,"All production sites producing wood-cased pencils are certified to . FSC® or PEFC™ standards. For sites which do not produce wood .  products, these two certification schemes are not relevant. All 22 .  sales companies are certified according to the FSC® Chain of Custody . standard. This means that every product can be traced from raw .  material, through all production steps, to the finished pencil in stock."
11,0.5,"Moreover, the Faber-Castell Social Charter and the associated .  compliance with social and labour standards apply to all production . and sales sites worldwide. For more information on the Social Charter, . please see the “Social Indicators” section."
11,0.4,"Faber-Castell continuously trains selected employees as internal .  auditors in order to ensure that all specifications are observed or .  implemented worldwide. These internal auditors regularly audit .  business processes according to standards."
11,0.7,"The integrated management system FABIQUS (Faber-Castell integrated . management system for quality, environment and social affairs), .  introduced globally in 1998, was modernised and optimised in Germany . in 2016 by the addition of a CAQ1 system, to manage standardised . documents and implemented processes in an optimal way. “FABIQUS 2.0” . has already been rolled out in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. . There are plans to incorporate additional global subsidiaries, starting . with Peru and Malaysia."

13,0.16666666666666669,"Challenges: . Lower greenhouse gas emissions are essential to curb-. ing climate change and global warming. Faber-Castell, . too, is committed to continuously reducing CO2 emis-. sions. However, to be able to take corporate decisions . on  environment-related actions, it is essential to have a . comprehensive and robust record of all greenhouse gas . emissions. That said, the broader you define system . boundaries, the less reliable available data becomes and . the less impactful it can be influenced. Faber-Castell . has therefore decided to work within quite close bound-. aries and to record not only all direct and indirect .  emissions from Scopes 1 and 2, but also the movement . of goods within the Group and all business travel. With .  respect to the movement of goods, it should be noted . that the choice of transport method (air vs. land freight) . is often made by the customer and Faber-Castell cannot . always influence this."
13,0.33333333333333337,"Faber-Castell is a climate protector. Faber-Castell’s pine plantations in Brazil, originally . planted more than 30 years ago, make a positive .  contribution to climate protection. As they grow, they . absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and bind carbon.  . The CO2 bound in this way offsets the global emissions . of Faber-Castell’s production facilities."
13,0.08333333333333334,""
13,0.41666666666666663,"Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions . Scope 1 represents all emissions created by the company, . including emissions from production processes, .  emissions from transport vehicles such as forklifts and . the emissions resulting from captive energy production. . Following a rise in the 2016/17 financial year, Scope 1 . emissions have fallen slightly to 6,050 t CO2e and thus . account for only one eighth of total emissions..  .  . Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions from  . purchased energy. Scope 2 energy consumption, including purchases of . energy and heating, has fallen by 13 percent and total . carbon emissions by as much as 17 percent. This trend . was mainly caused by a higher share of electricity . from renewable sources (increase from 61 percent in . 2016/17 to 63 percent in 2017/18). After Austria, our . largest plant in Brazil has now also purchased 100 .  percent of its electricity from renewable energy sources. . Furthermore, Faber-Castell has committed itself to .  further increase the share of renewable energies used."
13,0.25,"Scope 3: Other indirect GHG emissions . Scope 3 covers emissions that can only be indirectly .  attributed to the company. A distinction is made between . business travel and freight transport. The latter remains . the main factor within Scope 3. After rising continuously . in recent years, indirect emissions decreased significantly . by 26 percent in the 2017/18 financial year. Brazil’s 66 . percent reduction in international air freight compared  . to the previous year is the main reason for this fall in . emissions."

Total carbon . emissions dropped significantly by 26 percent in the 17/18 financial year, after years of growth. This is due to a . slight decline in production, higher demand for electricity from renewable sources and less use of air freight.  . The Faber-Castell Group’s largest site accounts for the highest share of CO2 emissions: Brazil (28 percent compared . to 42 percent in the prior year), closely followed by Germany (22 percent vs. 17 percent in 2017/18 financial year). .

In addition, .  hydropower from the neighbouring river is used to generate . electricity at the Stein site. The 176 percent increase  . in biodiesel can be attributed to better data collection in . Indonesia.. Overall, the consumption of direct renewable energies  . fell by 30 percent due to the reduced use of biomass in . Brazil. The Faber-Castell Group generates more than 82 . percent of its required thermal and electrical energy from . renewable sources.

Planet – Natural resources must be preserved and climate . change measures taken to ensure that present and future . generations can live in an intact environment.. Prosperity – Prosperity for all must be encouraged and all . people should participate in economic, social and technical . progress.. Peace – A life in peace must be promoted, with a society . without fear and violence.. Partnerships – Global partnerships must be developed so . that the goals can be achieved together through international . cooperation."
25,0.28571428571428575,"For Faber-Castell, the goals No. 1 (No poverty), No. 2 . (Zero hunger), No. 3 (Good health and well-being), No. 4 . (Quality education), No. 5 (Gender equality) and No. 10 . (Reduced inequalities) are an integral part of the goal of . decent work and economic growth. The goals can be sup-. ported through complying with the Social Charter, since . Faber-Castell employees, for example, have safe working . conditions, receive regular fair payments and have access . to clean drinking water.. The goals already set by Faber-Castell were compared . and linked with the SDGs (see page 30f). In the coming . years, the analysis and work on the United Nations’ goals . will be integrated into the stakeholder survey for 2020 . and further concrete goals and indicators will be defined . based on the results."

28,0.5714285714285715,"How we act fairly and correctly:  . the new Faber-Castell Charter. The corporate success of . Faber-Castell is based on . trusting and fair dealings . with employees, business . partners, customers and . suppliers. These values . have not only been prac-. tised in the company for . many generations, they are also the principles of the . “Honourable Merchant”, a model dating back to the . Middle Ages, which is still relevant centuries later. . The honourable merchant is committed to adhering . to values and rules, but also creates the conditions . for honourable action and assumes responsibility for . his deeds. As part of the Compliance Management . System (“CMS”), a code of conduct was drawn up  . in cooperation between the Faber-Castell family, the . Supervisory Board, the Executive Board and the . Compliance Committee: the Faber-Castell Charter.  . It lists 15 points that help every employee to act .  fairly and transparently – in line with our corporate . values. “The binding Code of Conduct is intended  . to give employees throughout the company guidance . and security,” says Thomas Wagner, Head of .  Compliance. An independent lawyer also provides . support as an ombudsman, whom employees can . contact anonymously. The Code of Conduct sets out . what has been part of our philosophy for centuries: . fairness, transparency and respect. Only in this way . can we maintain the high brand confidence among . our customers and ensure the profitable growth of . the company – in the spirit of an honourable merchant."
28,0.28571428571428575,"Challenges. Faber-Castell adopted a socially responsible approach at . an early stage. One of the first company health insurance . funds in Germany was founded as early as 1844, the . first nursery school was opened in Stein in 1851 and in . 1865 apartments were made available for workers. The . signing of the Social Charter in 2000 was another .  important step forward in terms of working and employ-. ment conditions. Strict cooperation with local companies . and independent partners such as trade unions, adapted . to the conditions in each country, is crucial for imple-. menting the Social Charter in practice. Being successful . as a company in the long term requires motivated and . satisfied employees to carry the company into the future . through creativity, innovation, enthusiasm and curiosity. . Rapidly changing market conditions, rapid technological . progress, compatibility of family and career and the . work/life balance are basic conditions that demand .  flexible working conditions. Custom continuing education . and further training programmes, attractive employment . conditions and respect for social responsibility on the . part of a family business are indispensable for Faber-. Castell."

The six skin colour pencils developed with the help of make-up experts can be mixed . to create every shade of colour.
