3,1.0,"Letter from the CEO"
3,0.75,"Dear Readers,"
3,0.5,"Before talking about Vossloh’s performance in the past fiscal year and looking ahead to the future, I want to . take this opportunity to commemorate a truly remarkable person. On February 23, we received the shocking . news that our majority shareholder Heinz Hermann Thiele had passed away. Mr. Thiele provided Vossloh with . enormous support in a financial and mainly personal capacity for the better part of a decade. He was our . supporter and our critic. He had a significant influence on our Company during his years of service as Chair-. man of the Supervisory Board, and his incomparable wealth of experience enriched us in countless ways. His . strength, discipline and courage spurred us on, and his unwavering commitment gave us stability during . Vossloh’s realignment. We are mourning the loss of a truly unique individual. Our deepest sympathies are with . his bereaved family."
3,0.625,"The header for my letter in the 2019 annual report stated “In 2019 we built the foundation for the future of . Vossloh.” Looking back, we could not have implemented our extensive performance program at a better time . – particularly in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Halfway through 2019, nobody could have . imagined the acid test that we would all be facing just a few months later. The pandemic fundamentally . changed every part of our lives in 2020, and continues to do so today. COVID-19 has affected us all individually . and as a society. And of course also economically."
3,0.25,"The pandemic has, without a doubt, caused more economic damage across the world than anyone thought . possible. Many sectors are acutely threatened in their diversity or even in their continued existence. The  . coronavirus outbreak has also shown that certain areas of the economy are more robust in a crisis than . others. The rail infrastructure market is undoubtedly among them. Passenger and freight rail transport are a . critical part of our system. Making sure that they are reliable is particularly important in times of crisis. 2020 . definitely left a mark on Vossloh. The year’s events demanded a lot from our employees, both personally and . professionally. But the results of our work in the last fiscal year are clear to see."
3,0.375,"Orders received increased by 5.6 percent year on year on a comparable basis, while the order backlog at the . end of 2020 was up 8.2 percent on the previous year. Our customers did not cancel any significant orders. . Sales went up slightly when adjusted for portfolio effects despite our customers delaying around  . €90 million in orders for Vossloh services and products due to the pandemic. The EBIT margin came to  . 8.4 percent and exceeded our originally communicated forecast. This figure includes pandemic-related burdens . of approximately 25 million, which were partly offset by a positive book effect of almost €16 million in connec-. tion with the transitional consolidation of a Chinese joint venture."
3,0.125,"This past fiscal year was a thoroughly successful one in other areas as well. After years of realignment and . restructuring, 2020 marks a major turning point in the history of the Vossloh Group. Vossloh completed the . transformation into a company focused exclusively on rail infrastructure when it finalised the sale of Vossloh . Locomotives at the end of May 2020. The Transportation division had been a significant financial burden for . the Group for a number of years. Vossloh can now move on and look to the future with confidence. It is time . for us to focus on our strengths and expand our strong position in the rail infrastructure market."

4,1.0,"“ With our products and services, . we are making a significant . contribution to the future of . sustainable mobility.”"
4,0.16666666666666669,"Oliver Schuster  CEO"
4,0.5,"We used 2020 for the last fine-tuning of our corporate strategy and to chart our path precisely into the future. . In summary, Vossloh’s strategic approach is to expand its existing business of products and services while . increasing profitability. This strong foundation will be used to develop digital business models and scale them . up. In addition, our strategic initiatives focus on accelerating the development of digital expertise, increasing . process efficiency in every area of the company, and placing greater emphasis on sustainable business practices. . Placing a €150 million hybrid note in February 2021 significantly improved the structure of our balance sheet. . It will also help us to implement our strategy from a financial perspective."
4,0.33333333333333337,"The importance of rail systems is growing quickly around the world. Many countries are now far more willing . to invest in their rail networks than they have been in the past, with generous subsidy schemes becoming . increasingly commonplace. The EU Commission has designated 2021 as the “European Year of Rail“. Megatrends . like population growth, urbanisation, globalisation, digitisation and the increasing importance of sutaina-. bility are guaranteed to shift traffic to rail as the most environmentally friendly mode of transport. There are . a number of factors which make it impossible to expand rail networks in proportion with the increasing . amount of traffic. As a result, increasing the availability of these networks will be extremely important.  . Modern management and safety systems and digital interlockings will make it possible for network operators . to significantly increase traffic density on rail lines without compromising on safety. More traffic means more . wear on track components, which will drive up demand for Vossloh’s products and services. As the level of . route utilization goes up, the amount of time available for track maintenance will go down. At the same time . a higher density of traffic in the rail network will also exacerbate the economic impact of disruption. This will . increase demand for effective, efficient and predictive maintenance. This is an area with a great deal of  . additional potential for Vossloh. Our unique selling point is that we know more about the physics of all of the . main track components than anyone else and, crucially, their systemic interaction. By assessing current track . conditions and forecasting changes, Vossloh can not only provide customers with recommendations about . how to optimize their maintenance practices, but also offer to carry out this work itself. We are currently  . deploying measurement technology on our maintenance vehicles. When combined with stationary data  . recorded on the track, this will provide a well-rounded picture of the condition of the track. That’s why we are . the ideal partner to develop condition-based and predictive maintenance plans together with our customers. . The projects that Vossloh has been awarded in Sweden and France are a clear indication that we are on the . right path."
4,0.8333333333333333,"5"
5,0.16666666666666669,"What does all of this mean for Vossloh in practice? We are confident that our sales will grow by between four . and five percent on average per year over the medium term. This far exceeds the growth which relevant  . studies are forecasting for the rail infrastructure market. UNIFE, the Association of the European Rail Industry, . recently published a forecast predicting that the market would grow by 2.3 percent per year. In terms of  . profitability, we aim to achieve a double-digit EBIT margin in every division over the medium term. This is also . the long-term EBIT margin target for the Group as a whole. This corresponds to an EBITDA margin of roughly . 16 percent. We are currently planning for sales revenues of between €850 million and €925 million in the 2021 . fiscal year. We expect the EBIT margin to be between 7 and 8 percent. This corresponds to an EBITDA margin . of between 13 and 14 percent. When adjusted for the one-time effect of just under €16 million in 2020 men-. tioned above, this would represent a significant increase in our operational profitability."
5,0.5,"Dear shareholders, Vossloh is currently in a better position than ever before. Our consistent efforts in recent . years are clearly paying off – for Vossloh and thus also for you. After suspending dividends in the previous year . due to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, we are firmly convinced that we are now in a position to . give you a regular and appropriate share in the Company‘s success in the future. The Executive Board and . Supervisory Board of Vossloh AG will therefore propose a dividend of €1.00 per share for the 2020 fiscal year . at the Annual General Meeting scheduled for May 19, 2021. This would correspond to just over 40 percent of . our net income from continuing operations attributable to our shareholders."
5,0.33333333333333337,"The Executive Board has set itself some ambitious targets. We are confident that we will achieve them. I am . very pleased that Mr. Jan Furnivall and Dr. Thomas Triska, long-standing members of the management team, . have joined the Vossloh Group’s Executive Board. Together, we will do everything in our power to make sure . that your company continues to increase in value while leading Vossloh into a successful future. The signs are . more promising for the rail industry than they have been in quite some time. Vossloh has the range of products . and services it needs to not only benefit from the rail renaissance in the digital age, but also be a driving force . in this trend. We have a strong and experienced team which is committed to innovation and in tune with the . needs of our customers. We make a significant contribution to climate protection and green mobility. That’s . why our motto for this annual report is “Vossloh – enabling green mobility”. Please continue to accompany . us on this journey, dear shareholders, and stay with us."

As one of the global market leaders, Vossloh . is active in all of the largest rail markets and is highly trusted by its cus-. tomers. Sustainability is an increasingly important topic for society at large. . Achieving ambitious climate targets will only be possible if we shift  . people and goods onto the rail network. Rail’s status as the most environ-. mentally friendly form of mass transport will become increasingly impor-. tant over the coming decades. Vossloh will both drive this trend and . noticeably benefit from it."

12,0.25,"In addition to sustainability, other me-. gatrends like population growth, urbani-. zation, globalization and digitalization . will have a positive impact on the rail  . industry and spur significant growth. . Mobility is at a turning point. The gro-. wing global population and urbanization . as well as the globalized trade are making . sustainable mobility and sustainable . transport absolutely vital. This will invari-. ably lead to an increase in traffic on the . rail network, as this means of transport . makes efficient use of resources and pro-. duces low levels of emissions, making it . by far the most sustainable means of . transport.. However, expanding existing route net-. works in proportion with the increasing . amount of traffic on the rails is not feasi-. ble for a number of reasons, particularly . in the near future. Therefore, it will  . become a matter of key importance to  . increase the availability of rail infrastruc-. ture, and tracks in particular. Modern . train control systems like ETCS (European . Train Control System) and the ongoing . shift towards using digital signal boxes . will make it possible to increase capacity . in the medium term. . The resulting increase in traffic density . will drive up the amount of wear on track . components. This trend will benefit Vossloh . due to its wide range of cutting-edge  . products and comprehensive services. . As the level of route utilization increa-. ses, the amount of time available for . maintenance measures decreases. This . means that maintenance models need to"
12,0.5,"become much more efficient, ideally iden-. tifying and remedying defects before they . lead to serious problems. As traffic density . goes up, so too does the potential economic . damage caused by delays and routes . being unavailable. Furthermore, rapid . preventive maintenance technologies will . become even more important in the future. . Vossloh’s patented high-speed grinding, . for example, makes it possible to perform . maintenance work almost entirely without . route disruption and reduces the likeli-. hood of severe rail defects when employed . on a regular basis.. Vossloh now distinguishes itself from . its competitors worldwide through its . uniquely comprehensive range of cutting-. edge track-related products and services. . We know more about the physics of all of . the main components than anyone else, . and, crucially, how they interact with . each other.

We will not tolerate any . violation of the law or of our internal guidelines and policies and . will sanction any such behavior (zero tolerance policy).” The . Compliance Commitment is also published on the Company’s . website. The Executive Board of Vossloh AG has put a Compliance- . Management-System in place for the Vossloh Group. The Vossloh . Compliance-Management-System is designed to identify  . compliance violation risks and to minimize these risks in order to . prevent Vossloh and its employees from incurring damage and . liability risks. Anticorruption and the strict observance of  . antitrust regulations play a particularly important role."
26,0.33333333333333337,"Since 2007, the Vossloh Compliance-Management-System has . been based on the Vossloh Code of Conduct, which stipulates . and precisely defines the values of integrity and upstanding . business conduct and is mandatory for the entire Group and all . employees. The Code of Conduct was comprehensively revised . and enhanced in 2016. With this and the compliance guidelines, . which apply equally throughout the Group and were likewise . revised in 2016, all the employees have a canon of rules that . serves as a yardstick for their daily work and helps them make . good and lawful decisions. The compliance rules are available in . the Group’s main languages and have been distributed to all . Vossloh Group employees around the world. Based on a  . compliance training concept, all the employees receive regular . training on compliance issues that is tailored to the target group . in question. Vossloh has also established a compliance e-learning . program for all employees with a computer workstation."
26,0.5,"To implement and monitor compliance, the Executive Board  . established the Compliance Organization, stipulating its struc-. ture, the responsibilities and tasks of the individual compliance . positions, and their reporting channels in the “Rules of Procedure . of the Compliance Organization.” The Vossloh Compliance . Organization comprises the Chief Compliance Officer (supported . by a Compliance Office), the Group Compliance Committee at . Vossloh AG, Compliance Officers and Compliance Committees . within the business units and Local Compliance Officers within . the operating companies. The Chief Compliance Officer regularly . reports to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board."

Grube, has two other Supervisory Board mandates at listed com-. panies (Hamburger Hafen- und Logistik AG as well as RIB Soft-. ware SE); he is the Chairman of one of these Supervisory Boards. . Furthermore, Prof. Dr. Grube holds four other mandates at non-. listed companies (please refer to the disclosure on the company’s . website) that could be considered to represent a similar function . within the meaning of DCGK Recommendation C.4. In the opinion . of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board, Prof. Dr. Grube . makes an extremely valuable contribution to the company, not . least on account of his outstanding expertise and many years of . experience in the industry, and this contribution is not lessened . by the additional mandates referred to herein.

27,0.13333333333333333,"Explanation: The Supervisory Board considers the share price-. based components of the variable remuneration of the Executive . Board, which currently account for approx. one-third of the vari-. able Executive Board remuneration, as being sufficient. The  . Supervisory Board is of the opinion that any greater weighting . of share price-based remuneration components could weaken . the focus on the sustainable achievement of key operational . performance indicators. In addition, the Supervisory Board takes . into account the fact that for share price-based remuneration . components, changes in the share price depend not only on the . performance of the Executive Board members, but also on exter-. nal factors over which the company and its bodies do not have . any influence. In light of the recommendation of the DCGK that . the first-time appointment of Executive Board members should . not exceed a period of three years – a recommendation that is . regularly practiced by the company – the Supervisory Board . does not believe that a four-year measurement period for the . long-term variable remuneration of Executive Board members .

The Core Components division is . made up of two business units, Fastening Systems and Tie Technologies. The two other divisions encompass . one business unit each: Vossloh Switch Systems belongs to Customized Modules, and Vossloh Rail Services . belongs to Lifecycle Solutions. You can find detailed descriptions of the individual divisions on page 46 et . seq. Vossloh Locomotives was the last business unit in the Transportation division and was part of the Group . until the end of May 2020. The legal representatives of Vossloh AG signed a contract on August 26, 2019, for . the sale of this business unit to CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd., Zhuzhou, China (CRRC ZELC), a subsidiary . of CRRC Corporation Ltd. The transaction was completed on May 31, 2020 after it was approved by the . relevant authorities."
33,0.5,"Vossloh holds the following competitive positions in the rail infrastructure sector:"
33,0.6,"- Vossloh is a leading global supplier and technological leader in rail fastening systems.. - Vossloh is a global market and technology leader in the switches and crossings segment.. -  In Germany, Vossloh is a leading supplier of innovative technologies and services for the entire lifecycle  . of rails and switches.. - In North America and Australia, Vossloh is a leading manufacturer of concrete ties."
33,0.8,"Strategic decisions"
33,0.3,"In mid-2020, Vossloh completed the transformation of the Group and transitioned into a company focused . on its core business of rail infrastructure. Vossloh’s unique selling point is its comprehensive range of . track-related products and services. Vossloh manufactures all significant track components. The associated . knowledge of the technical and physical properties of the rail track forms the basis for understanding the . systemic interaction of all components."
33,0.1,"Improving track availability will play a significant role in transporting more people and goods by  . environmentally friendly rail. Vossloh contributes to this in two different areas: The company is continuing . to enhance its rail infrastructure products to make them more durable, easier to maintain and more reliable. . Vossloh is also playing its part in making the process of maintaining rail networks more efficient. Digitalization . will be at the heart of this, as it enables the processing and evaluation of ever larger amounts of data. . Vossloh brings its comprehensive and systemic understanding of rail infrastructure to bear to derive relevant . information and maintenance recommendations from the collected data. This is the foundation for meeting . the specific needs of publicly and privately owned regional, freight and long-distance transport operators . and offering them tailored condition-based maintenance solutions."
33,0.4,"Vossloh’s existing business with products and conventional services forms the basis for the development . and expansion of the digital service business. The conventional hardware business and the constantly . growing service business form an inseparable unit. The new possibilities afforded by digitalization and, . most importantly, the efficient processing and analysis of large amounts of data serve as the link that  . joins the business models."
33,0.7,"34"
34,0.5,"Vossloh aligned itself to clearly defined strategic cornerstones in 2020 as part of an extensive internal project, . while also defining its role in the international rail infrastructure market. The strategy newly devised and . pursued by Vossloh is divided into three sub-areas:"
34,0.375,"-  The existing business with products pertaining to rail infrastructure will be expanded and further . strengthened with a view to their profitability. In this context, the focus is on sustainable reduction  . of production costs, increased sales concentration on selected markets, and also acquisitive expansion  . of the product portfolio with complementary products as well as an entire series of selective innovations.. -  The existing service business will be further internationalized and expanded to include further service . offerings. The focus of smart maintenance is on the collection of condition data, both directly on the  . track and through Vossloh’s own fleet of maintenance vehicles and using artificial intelligence to draw up . condition-based, predictive maintenance programs. This provides customers with an outstanding  . opportunity to improve their efficiency levels.. -  The new strategy also focuses on accelerating the development of digital expertise, including through . relevant partnerships, and emphasizes the importance of sustainable management more strongly than . before. At the same time, a Group-wide system for continuously increasing efficiency in every division  . has been designed."
34,0.125,"Strategic measures were implemented and reviewed on a regular basis. The new strategy will contribute . significantly towards achieving an average annual sales growth rate of between 4 and 5 percent over the . medium term. This improvement would be well above the rate currently forecast for the market in a number . of studies. Vossloh also expects all of its divisions to achieve double-digit EBIT margins over the medium term. . Vossloh intends for the Group as a whole to achieve an EBIT margin of at least 10 percent over the long term. . A double-digit EBIT margin for the Vossloh Group equates to an EBITDA margin of at least 16 percent."

34,0.25,"The Vossloh Group is active around the world. Local presence and customer proximity are integral elements  . of our business activities. Important production sites for the Fastening Systems business unit are located in . Germany, China, Poland, the USA and Russia. In the year under review, a further production facility for certain . rail fastening system components was added in China through the full consolidation of the company Vossloh . (Anyang) Track Material. The Tie Technologies business unit manufactures concrete ties in the USA, Mexico, . Canada and Australia. The switch systems in the Customized Modules division are manufactured primarily in . France, Sweden, Australia, Luxembourg, Poland, Finland, the United Kingdom, India and China.

35,1.0,"Controlling system"
35,0.8,"The most significant financial performance indicators for the Vossloh Group are value added, sales revenues, . EBITDA margin and EBIT margin1. While the Company uses sales revenues, EBITDA margin and EBIT margin . as key performance indicators for short-term planning, the long-term management of the business units . within the framework of the value-oriented growth strategy is focused on value added. Value added is the . management-relevant earnings indicator for the divisions and business units within the framework of . external reporting."
35,0.7,"Positive value added is generated when a premium is earned on top of the return claimed by investors and . lenders (cost of capital). This premium is the difference between the return on capital employed (ROCE, . calculated as EBIT/Capital employed) and the cost of capital, which is calculated as the weighted average . cost of equity and debt. Multiplying the premium by average capital employed produces the value added . over a period in absolute terms. For internal controlling purposes, ROCE and value added are determined . before taxes."
35,0.3,"Cost of equity is composed of a risk-free interest rate plus a market risk premium. The interest rate factor is . adjusted accordingly on the basis of the input tax consideration. Cost of debt is calculated on the basis of . the Group’s average financing terms. The ratio of equity to interest-bearing debt of two-thirds to one-third, . which is used to determine WACC, is not derived from the balance sheet since it is not only predicated on a . benchmark for the funding structure but also because equity is based on target market values in this case . and not the carrying amounts recognized in the balance sheet. A weighted average cost of capital before . taxes (WACC) of 7.0 percent was based on the yield expected by investors and lenders for the purposes of . intragroup controlling in the 2020 fiscal year (previous year: 7.5 percent)."
35,0.6,"There are two ways of increasing value added: increasing EBIT and optimizing capital employed. ROCE is . derived from both values. Vossloh seeks to improve the parameters it can influence to optimize this . performance indicator. As a result, the Company additionally focuses on working capital, working capital . intensity (average working capital/annual revenue) and free cash flow."
35,0.4,"Management uses nonfinancial performance indicators for the purpose of managing the company and . making long-term strategic decisions. However, nonfinancial performance indicators do not play a central . role in the management of the company. Instead, they provide information about the situation within the . Group and are used as a basis for decisions. The Vossloh Group has no nonfinancial performance indicators of . significance for the activities of the company. Further nonfinancial performance indicators which do not play . a central role in management are provided in the nonfinancial Group statement, which begins on page 80."
35,0.5,"To the management of Vossloh AG, the monthly financial reporting represents a central element for the . ongoing analysis and control of the divisions, business units and the Group itself. To this end, the financial . statements and key performance indicators prepared by the consolidated Group companies are consolidated . and analyzed in the same way as the monthly annual forecast. Deviations are investigated in relation to . their effects on the financial targets. The monthly and annual projections are supplemented by a risk report . to identify potential reductions and increases in assets. The effectiveness of measures aimed at ensuring . targets are reached is continuously analyzed. The figures of the operating units are intensively discussed by . their respective management and the Group Executive Board with the involvement of the relevant central . departments of Vossloh AG."

36,0.25,"Investments in rail infrastructure are generally made around the world on the basis of long-term  . decision-making processes. For this reason, short-term economic developments are only reflected in the . sales markets for rail technology to a limited extent. More significant is the development of debt levels in . Vossloh’s sales markets, as the majority of the Group’s clients are public-sector customers. The debt ratio . (the ratio of public debt to GDP) of the euro countries at the end of the third quarter of 2020 was 97.3 percent . according to the statistics office of the European Union (Eurostat). This was the most recent figure available . when this annual report was prepared. The debt ratio was 85.8 percent at the end of the third quarter  . of 2019. At the end of September 2020, the debt ratio of the entire EU was 89.8 percent, compared to  . 79.2 percent in the previous year. The higher debt ratios result from substantial increases in sovereign debt .

36,0.375,"From a global perspective, the rail technology market has shown a steadily growing trend for years.  . This is the result of rising demand around the world for environmentally friendly, safer and more economical . mobility for people and goods. The driving forces for this development include megatrends such as population . growth, urbanization, the increase of international trade flows and, most significantly, increasing environ-. mental awareness. Passengers and freight needs to be shifted onto the rail network if we want to increase . their mobility while also reducing their environmental footprint in the interest of combating climate change. . The European Union has designated the year 2021 as the “European Year of Rail“ to promote the climate . targets for the transport sector defined in the European Green Deal. In addition, the rail sector is under-. going a profound transformation due to digitalization, automation and artificial intelligence, but also due  . to the standardization and liberalization of rail transport. At the same time, competitive pressure has been . rising, also as a result of new players on the market."
36,0.625,"A number of studies regularly analyze developments in the global rail technology market. The most . important of these is the World Rail Market Study, published by European rail industry association UNIFE. . The study is updated every two years; the most recent results were published in October 2020."
36,0.5,"According to UNIFE, the current global volume of the rail market is around €177 billion per year.  . The Association of the European Rail Industry considers about 62 percent of the total volume – some  . €110 billion – to be an accessible market share. Accessible means that this market is accessible in principle . to European suppliers and market demand is not exclusively met through domestic manufacturers."
36,0.125,"Since the completed sale of the Locomotives business unit, Vossloh has focused exclusively on products and . services for rail infrastructure. The market segments of infrastructure and infrastructure services are therefore . of particular importance for Vossloh. Based on UNIFE data, the accessible share of the infrastructure market . (excluding electrification) was worth around €18 billion per year on average between 2017 and 2019. . Roughly 35 percent of market volume is currently accounted for by Western Europe and approximately  . 30 percent by NAFTA countries (USA, Canada and Mexico) according to UNIFE data. These are followed by . the Asia Pacific region with roughly 14 percent, Eastern Europe with 8 percent and Africa/Middle East with  . 6 percent. Markets in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Latin America represent smaller . portions of the accessible market volume at approximately 4 percent and 3 percent respectively. The total . volume of the accessible infrastructure services market is currently worth around €6 billion based on UNIFE . data, equivalent to approximately 40 percent of the total infrastructure services market."

37,0.16666666666666669,"The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the . Vossloh Group in the 2020 fiscal year. However, the crisis has had less of an impact on Vossloh and the rail . infrastructure industry as a whole than it has had on other sectors. The transport of goods and people is . particularly crucial in times of crisis. For this reason, the rail industry is only being affected by official . measures to a relatively limited extent in most countries. The majority of the customers are in the public . sector and are therefore relatively unaffected by economic developments. In addition, the majority of the . business is related to the necessary maintenance of existing rail networks, which cannot be completely . avoided even in times of limited financing. As a result, there were no significant order cancellations in the . 2020 fiscal year, and orders received exceeded sales. However, the pandemic still had some negative impact . on the operations of the Vossloh Group. Sales revenues and EBIT were negatively affected by customers . rescheduling projects and the loss of efficiency caused by temporary production shutdowns."

Vossloh could not escape the effects of the pandemic. However, it was far less affected . than companies in other sectors due to the relatively crisis-resistant nature of its business. The sale of the . Transportation division was another major event in the 2020 fiscal year. It marked the end of the Vossloh . Group’s lengthy and extensive process of strategic realignment."
44,0.2222222222222222,"Vossloh is resilient in a crisis due to a number of factors. The need to keep the transport network going is . particularly pressing in times of crisis. The majority of Vossloh’s customers are in the public sector and less . susceptible to economic trends. Replacements and maintenance are an integral part of operating rail . networks, and cannot be delayed indefinitely. The pandemic-related sales and earnings effects are therefore . mainly temporary shifts that should largely be made up for in the coming years."

The EBIT margin far exceeded the previous year and the original forecast for 2020, and . was at the upper end of the most recent EBIT margin forecast of between 7.5 percent and 8.5 percent.  . It was buoyed by a carrying amount adjustment recognized in profit and loss as a result of the transitional . consolidation of a Chinese joint venture. Sales and earnings were more than satisfactory given the general . economic situation."
44,0.6666666666666667,"The order situation was also extremely robust. When adjusted for the US switch business, which was sold, . orders received went up by 5.6 percent. The book-to-bill ratio of the Group was 1.05. The order backlog . grew by 8.2 percent compared to the previous year’s figure.

44,0.4444444444444444,"The Group’s financial position also improved significantly. The equity ratio went up to just above 34 percent. . Net financial debt fell year on year, mainly as a result of a considerable improvement in free cash flow from . continuing operations. This was another area in which the Vossloh Group performed well."
44,0.1111111111111111,"The 2020 fiscal year was also highly successful from a strategic perspective. The sale of the Locomotives . business unit was completed at the end of May. Negative effects related to this business unit (such as its . free cash flow of €(54 .1) million and earnings per share of €(1.49)) will not be incurred in future. Vossloh . published an revised corporate strategy containing medium and long-term financial ambitions (see page 34 . Business and Market Environment) at the end of 2020. Vossloh will expand its existing business with products . and services, and use this as a foundation for establishing and expanding digital-based business models, . which include maintenance services.

50,0.4444444444444444,"For the 2020 fiscal year, Vossloh AG reported sales revenues of €7.5 million (previous year: €5.2 million) . resulting primarily from intercompany allocations with Group companies that obtain a wide range of . services via Vossloh AG (mainly in the areas of IT and marketing). Operating expenses were mainly incurred . in connection with the Company’s management and financing functions. The business performance and . economic development of Vossloh AG follow the activities of its subsidiaries and investees. The most . significant performance indicators for Vossloh AG are the general administrative expenses, the net financial . result and the result after tax/net income."
50,0.33333333333333337,"At €19.8 million, the administrative expenses in 2020 were slightly higher than in the previous year  . (€18.7 million), although a decrease had been expected in the previous year. This increase was due, among . other things, to higher consulting costs, which at €3.6 million were significantly higher than in the previous . year (€2.1 million) as a result of the strategic project carried out in the year under review. Personnel . expenses came to €11.6 million (previous year: €13.4 million). The significant decrease was caused by the . performance program that was implemented in the previous year. Trade fair costs remained roughly on a par . with the previous year due to the InnoTrans industry trade fair not taking place in the year under review due . to the COVID-19 pandemic."
50,0.5555555555555556,"The considerable decrease in other operating expenses from €7.2 million in the previous year to €3.5 million . was due to lower exchange rate losses from the hedging of intragroup receivables from Group companies  . in countries which use foreign currencies. Other operating income saw a sharp rise to €12.3 million . (previous year: €5.0 million) due to a subsequent purchase price component from the sale of Vossloh Kiepe . GmbH and the sale of Vossloh Locomotives GmbH. The previous year’s figure was dominated by the release . of provisions and price gains."
50,0.1111111111111111,"The net financial result improved slightly year on year by €0.9 million and totaled €(42.0) million in 2020. . This was largely due to write-downs on investments due to a permanent impairment of €47.0 million . (previous year: €26.3 million). Income from profit transfer agreements went down to €13.1 million in the . year under review (previous year: €18.8 million), while expenses from losses absorbed saw a considerable . downturn from €60.5 million in the previous year to €28.6 million in the year under review.

51,0.33333333333333337,"Interest expenses totaling €8.9 million (previous year: €9.1 million) for the year under review stood opposite . interest income of €9.6 million (previous year: €14.2 million), primarily from passing on these funds in the . form of short and long-term loans to Group companies. Loss carryforwards kept income taxes low at  . €0.0 million (previous year: €0.1 million). Vossloh AG’s net loss in the reporting year was €53.0 million . (previous year: €63.5 million). The forecast in the 2019 annual report expected a significant improvement in . the result after taxes. At end of 2019, there was another unexpected delay to the finalization of the sale of . Vossloh Locomotives. This and the aforementioned write-down on an investment significantly counteracted . the improvement in earnings compared to the 2019 fiscal year, which had been heavily impacted by . negative one-time effects related to the performance program."
51,0.6666666666666667,"Total assets came to €895.8 million, a decrease from the previous year’s figure of €953.9 million. The main . reason for this was the decrease in Group financing in the form of loans and short-term receivables from . affiliated companies."
51,0.4444444444444444,"Financial investments went down by €3.7 million to €603.0 million. An increase of €47 million in shares in . affiliated companies due to a refinancing of the US business and the aforementioned impairment of the . carrying amount of the investment offset each other. The disposal of Vossloh Locomotives GmbH only had  . a minor impact due to the investment being written down in the previous year. Current assets decreased by . €57.4 million to €288.6 million, largely as a result of a decrease of €50.1 million in short-term receivables . from affiliated companies. There were no significant changes in other assets."

Equity fell . from €553.1 million to €500.1 million due to the net loss. The equity ratio went down year on year from  . 58.0 percent to 55.8 percent due to equity falling at a sharper rate than total assets."

In addition, the report describes the principles and amount of Supervisory Board remuneration."
52,0.33333333333333337,"Purpose. The objective of the remuneration system for the Executive Board is to ensure that the Executive . Board members are appropriately remunerated in accordance with their area of activity and responsibility, . in line with the statutory requirements and taking into account the recommendations of the German . Corporate Governance Code, in order to make a significant contribution to promoting and implementing the . corporate strategy of Vossloh AG, namely strengthening the product business and further expanding the . conventional and digital service business with the aim of sustainably increasing the value of the company. . Criteria for the appropriate remuneration of Executive Board members are based on each member’s function . and individual performance, Vossloh AG’s economic situation, success and sustainable future prospects in . addition to customary remuneration polices in view of the Company’s comparative environment, remuneration . structure and their development over time."
52,0.1111111111111111,"Executive Board remuneration system. In connection with the personnel changes and the expansion of . the Executive Board from two to three members, the remuneration system for the Executive Board was . revised in the fall of 2020 and, in particular, supplemented with a quantified maximum remuneration as well . as malus and clawback provisions. The adjustments serve in particular to implement the new requirements . of the Act Implementing the Second Shareholders’ Rights Directive (ARUG II) and take into account the  . new recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code as amended on December 16, 2019.  . The Vossloh AG compensation system for Executive Board members as adopted by the Supervisory Board  . is available on the Company’s website and applies in principle from January 1, 2021. The new system has . already been incorporated in the employment contracts with the Executive Board members appointed as  . of November 1, 2020, but contains certain opening clauses for the incumbent CEO’s old contract. The . remuneration system is composed of fixed non-performance-related components and variable performance-. related components, the sum of which constitutes the total compensation for Executive Board members."
52,0.5555555555555556,"Basic remuneration is a fixed annual sum, based on the responsibilities of each Executive Board member . and is to be paid in twelve equal monthly installments. It also includes fringe benefits in the form of . payments in kind which mainly consist of private use of a company car and allowances for health insurance . and accident and baggage insurance. No separate remuneration was provided for services performed on . behalf of subsidiaries. The adjusted remuneration system does not include a company pension plan. An . exception in this respect still applies to the incumbent CEO, whose existing contract includes a commitment . for pension payments upon reaching an age limit of 63."
52,0.6666666666666667,"The basic remuneration in each case amounts to around 40 percent (around 53 percent with the pension . expense in the case of the incumbent CEO) of the target total remuneration, i.e., the total remuneration . assuming 100 percent target achievement of the variable remuneration components."
52,0.2222222222222222,"The variable remuneration components include the annual bonus and the multiyear bonus. The . predefined performance targets are based on financial performance indicators that can be measured . objectively and are considered a relevant indicator of the Vossloh Group’s economic performance and . strategy implementation, in addition to the performance of the Vossloh share. All performance targets  . are forward-looking and are (with the exception of the share price-based remuneration component) set  . by the Supervisory Board with target values before the beginning of each assessment period by means of . target agreements with the members of the Executive Board. Targets for the share price-based variable . remuneration component are derived directly from the relevant employment contracts. A subsequent change . of the target values is generally excluded. If 100 percent of the targets are met, the variable remuneration . components will contribute around 60 percent (around 47 percent in the case of the incumbent CEO . including the pension expense) to the total target remuneration of the Executive Board members."

52,0.8888888888888888,"53. Remuneration report"
53,0.7777777777777777,"The components of the variable remuneration are regulated in detail as follows:"
53,0.2222222222222222,"The annual bonus is determined on the basis of annual performance targets. If all of these targets are  . 100 percent achieved, the annual bonus amounts to slightly less than half of the total variable target . remuneration. The performance targets for the annual bonus are Group EBIT, Group sales and the average . capital employed of the Vossloh Group. The specific weighting of the performance targets and the associated . target values are determined before the beginning of the assessment period. The Supervisory Board can . reduce the bonus for 100 percent target achievement by up to 20 percent or increase it by up to 30 percent . at its discretion in the event of extraordinary developments."
53,0.1111111111111111,"The multiyear bonus amounts to slightly more than 50 percent of total variable target remuneration if all . multiyear performance targets are 100 percent achieved. ROCE (return on capital employed) accounts for  . 48 percent (for the CEO) and around 31 percent (for the other Executive Board members) of the performance . targets for the multiyear bonus. The remainder is split evenly between the absolute and the relative . performance of the Vossloh share. The relative performance of the Vossloh share is measured and assessed . by comparing it to the average performance of the DAX, MDAX and SDAX. The multiyear bonus still had a . two-year assessment period in the 2020 reporting year and has been measured over three years since . January 1, 2021 in the adjusted remuneration system. The three-year assessment period is already included . in the employment contracts of the Executive Board members newly appointed as of November 2020."
53,0.33333333333333337,"The achievement of targets for the annual bonus and the financial performance targets for the multiyear . bonus are determined annually by the Supervisory Board on the basis of the audited consolidated financial . statements. The component of the multiyear bonus related to the performance of the Vossloh share is . assessed on the basis of volume-weighted XETRA average share prices or the average closing prices of the . relevant indexes as published by Deutsche Börse AG. Both of these are taken from the 40 days immediately . before or after the assessment period. The target bonus is granted if the target is fully realized. The bonus . increases or decreases in relation to the target bonus depending on the achievement of the defined target . values. The annual bonus and the multiyear bonus are limited to a maximum of 170 percent of the respective . target bonus."
53,0.5555555555555556,"However, the Supervisory Board may use its discretion to set an extra bonus allocation for extraordinary . performance in the period under review. In the adjusted compensation, the amount of these possible extra . bonuses is limited to the target amount of the annual bonus."
53,0.8888888888888888,"Malus and clawback provisions. The new remuneration system also contains malus and clawback . provisions which allow the Supervisory Board to withhold or reclaim variable compensation components in . full or in part in justified cases."
53,0.4444444444444444,"Maximum remuneration. The remuneration of the individual Executive Board members is capped in . accordance with the new remuneration system.

In the fall of 2020, the Supervisory Board conducted a review of the Executive Board remuneration based on . the criteria of the German Corporate Governance Code as amended on December 16, 2019. Based on a . horizontal comparison (with comparable companies in a peer group) and a vertical comparison (with the . compensation of senior executives and the workforce as a whole), the Supervisory Board determined that . the remuneration of the Executive Board was appropriate and in line with market practice. The peer group . used for this purpose was already formed in 2017 with external support as part of the systematic review of . the Executive Board’s remuneration at that time and was last confirmed by the Supervisory Board in . November 2020. It mainly comprises manufacturing companies from the MDAX and SDAX. Compared to the . peer group, the remuneration granted to the Executive Board members is consistently below the average . and median, which is also due to the fact that Vossloh has slipped two places down the rankings within the . peer group in terms of revenue and employees respectively since 2017 following the realignment and"

In this way, Vossloh is contributing to an efficient rail infrastructure, which is a necessary prerequisite for the . environmentally friendly mobility of people and the transport of goods (“enabling green mobility”)."
63,0.25,"The digitalization of rail infrastructure opens up new opportunities for Vossloh to create value with its . products and services. Apps released by Vossloh combine measurements and track condition data, provide . a quick overview of which routes require action and suggest suitable measures for repairing damage. . Vossloh uses configurable IoT sensors to measure vibrations and provide data from different parts of the . track (rail ties, frogs, point machine etc.). This data is validated and compressed, and then sent to the Vossloh . Analytics Platform using a mobile phone network for analysis. The platform compiles data from measure-. ment instruments and sensors in various infrastructure components with data from Vossloh railgrinders to . provide an overall picture of the condition of the track. This makes it possible to prepare efficient forecasts . for the predictive maintenance of the rail network."
63,0.375,"Vossloh’s rail profiling machines are also used to diagnose issues with the track. They record data about the . condition of the track without disrupting rail schedules, and then send this data to an asset management . system, such as mapl-e or MR.Pro, both of which were developed in-house by Vossloh. In addition to . visualizing the condition of the track, mapl-e can also identify appropriate maintenance measures and . assess their economic viability. This enables asset managers to plan and budget for maintenance. In future, . Vossloh’s customers will be able to access measurement data, analyses, assessments and recommendations . from a secure area of the analysis platform. With this digital service, Vossloh wants to give its customers the . opportunity to significantly deepen their knowledge of their infrastructure and increase its availability . through targeted maintenance."
63,0.5,"Vossloh’s “Digital Twin” application enhances maintenance measures for point machines by combining . augmented reality with virtual reality: The “digital twin” provides a virtual depiction of a physical object  . or system, which includes comprehensive product and function data as well as a real-time visual overlay. . Vossloh also uses drones to generate digital three-dimensional models of busy routes. These 3D models can . be used to optimize track layouts, switch designs and overhead lines to increase speeds and capacity on . routes while reducing the need for maintenance."
63,0.625,"Switch disruptions are one of the main reasons for routes being unavailable and unplanned maintenance.  . In switch management in particular, digitalization has now created solutions to problems. In urban regional . transportation, for example, Vossloh’s compact electro-hydraulic Easydrive point machine can be equipped . with smart sensor technology for remote monitoring. With the Easyswitch MIM-H for mainline routes, . Vossloh has developed a new version of this point machine that distinguishes itself as a modular plug-and-. play solution with a high degree of reliability."

64,0.5555555555555556,"Digitalization also offers opportunities directly for the R&D activities of Vossloh: The research and  . development activities of every division are increasingly focused on data-processing technology – a trend . which continued in 2020. This makes it possible for multidimensional simulations such as the finite element . or multi-body simulation methods to be implemented more quickly and more economically than with . conventional methods. The innovative DYNADeV platform developed by Vossloh simulates wheel-rail . contact to predict the mechanical behavior of a switch. The simulation tool removes the need for expensive . track measurements and lengthy laboratory testing. In addition to accelerating the development and . certification process for switches, the virtual process also provides an indication of the impact that different . trains have on the rail infrastructure."
64,0.4444444444444444,"All of Vossloh’s innovations also focus on “quiet rails”. Noise and vibrations are a particular inconvenience . for people in dense urban areas. With dampening rail fasteners, “whisper switches” and acoustic rail . grinding, Vossloh helps to reduce noise emissions. All solutions in this area were further improved in 2020. . The Company also provides maintenance services that keep noise levels low. By using sensor technology to . monitor noise levels, Vossloh can target specific areas for grinding to guarantee long-term reductions in the . amount of noise created by the rail infrastructure – yet another example of how Vossloh is using digitalization . to improve the quality of life in urban areas."
64,0.2222222222222222,"Vossloh has long relied on the specific expertise of external specialists for some of its development work. . The Group has access to an extensive network of experts. The Company works closely with renowned . universities and research institutions throughout the world under the framework of longstanding partnerships. . Vossloh focuses on partnerships with technology companies and start-ups in the area of digitalization and . big data analysis. One example is Vossloh’s close partnership with Deutsche Bahn AG subsidiary DB . Systemtechnik GmbH in the area of data-based switch monitoring. The joint venture established with . Rhomberg Sersa represents a crucial partnership that offers a wide range of monitoring and maintenance . services for switches and rails. The MR.pro software provides the joint venture with a set of open system . digital tools  for evaluating and visualizing the condition and substance of track infrastructure."
64,0.33333333333333337,"In 2020, the R&D experts in the Core Components division continued to work on new solutions for increased . noise and vibration protection. This included looking at ways to increase the elasticity of the 336V and  . 300 UTS rail fastening systems used on local transport routes. Both systems use cellentic intermediate . layers. cellentic is a highly flexible elastomer. Components made from this material optimize the elasticity  . of the track. This reduces vibrations and protects the superstructure. Vossloh’s researchers also focused on . under-sleeper pads, which provide a vibration-reducing base for concrete ties. Vossloh has also been . researching the interaction between concrete ties and dowels as part of its efforts to make rails quieter.  . In 2020, the German Federal Railway Authority granted Vossloh’s application for its EPS project to enter . operational testing. This project focuses on developing innovative composite ties for different applications. . Vossloh’s experts have performed some basic research for a new generation of tension clamps and conducted . experiments to investigate the relationship between the lateral rigidity of tension clamps and reducing track . wear."
64,0.1111111111111111,"In 2020, the R&D engineers of the Customized Modules division also continued to test the new, ultra-resilient . rolled steel CogX. The heat-treated laminated steel for frogs and switch points was tested in additional . switch systems for trams and heavy-duty traffic. The material provides a higher level of resistance to wear . and impact compared to existing solutions, and extends service lives by up to 30 percent. The Company  . also continued practical tests of an energy-efficient completely hydraulic point machine and the digitally . controlled MIM-H point machine on high-speed routes. The COGISLIDE coating, developed by the Customized . Modules division, was integrated into the production process. This makes it possible for coated switch rail . chairs to be moved without lubrication. In 2020, the division entered into a strategically important partnership . agreement with France’s national state-owned railway company SNCF for all of its switch development projects."

New units were developed for high-speed railgrinders in 2020. These include units that . increase the amount that can be removed per pass, and others that provide an immediate indication of . grinding quality. The control system for high-performance milling was adapted to meet the requirements of . a rail operator. Vossloh made changes to the sensor system used for multi-purpose milling so that these . milling systems can also be deployed for switch points and stock rails. The division’s Logistics wing outfitted . its fleet of freight cars with composite brake shoes (LL brake shoes). This braking system keeps the running . surface of the wheels smooth, making them quieter than cars using standard cast iron brake shoes."
65,0.6,"In addition to enhancing its range of products and services, Vossloh is also making consistent improvements . to its production processes. The Company wants its factories to be smart and highly efficient. That’s why . Vossloh is building a “factory of the future” at its Werdohl site. This factory will produce tension clamps using . a digitally managed and highly automated process. Now that Vossloh has completed its “OT 2020” project, . the Company has an optimized frog production facility and a competence center for foundry technology in . Outreau. The Group’s two major switch plants specialize in specific stages along the value chain: Reichshoffen . focuses on metalworking, while the site in Fère-en-Tardenois focuses on final assembly and shipping. . Vossloh is also increasingly involved in international development projects which facilitate global partner-. ships and rapid communication. The Company uses cutting-edge communication and collaboration . solutions for these projects."

Vossloh has established a Group-wide risk and opportunity management system for  . this purpose. This system serves to prevent or mitigate negative effects resulting from changes while  . also identifying and harnessing opportunities that arise. The risk and opportunity management system . encompasses not only Vossloh AG itself but also all domestic and overseas subsidiaries in which Vossloh AG . has a direct or indirect shareholding, irrespective of whether these are consolidated in the Group’s financial . statements. The majority of the risks and opportunities which apply to the business of the Group also apply . to the business development of Vossloh AG. Acquired companies are promptly integrated into the system."
66,0.625,"The risk and opportunity management system is a component of the business, planning and control . process. The organization of structures and processes is documented in a Group-wide policy. The Group  . is preparing to adapt the policy in the 2021 fiscal year due to the additional requirements in the amended . version of the assurance standard IDW PS 340. The structure of the management system is based on the . structure of the operating processes of each of the organizational units. There are appointed Risk Managers, . Risk Officers and Risk Controllers at all levels of the group. A permanent inventory identifies risks and . opportunities on an ongoing basis and ensures that relevant risks are recorded effectively, promptly and . systematically."
66,0.25,"Vossloh evaluates risks and opportunities in regard to their potential impact on the results of operations. . The possible impact is primarily identified on the basis of EBIT, the financial performance indicator. Interest . and income tax risks and risks from discontinued operations are assessed in light of the impact of the risk . on net income. This evaluation determines not only the most likely outcome but also the worst case and . best case scenarios. In line with the value-at-risk method, a minimum probability of 5 percent is required  . for these. Additionally, an evaluation of the probability of occurrence is carried out. Nonfinancial risks and . opportunities are incorporated into risk reporting. These are assessed to determine their impact on . nonfinancial issues, such as environmental and labor concerns."
66,0.375,"Vossloh documents and communicates risks and opportunities in standardized reports. They contain . detailed information on risks and opportunities, the parameters by which they are evaluated, and potential . measures to manage these risks or harness these opportunities. The risks and opportunities report is issued . on a quarterly basis. It supplements the current annual outlook and also addresses predictable and adequately . specific risks and opportunities for the following years. Ad hoc reports round out the regular reports and . provide the means to assess the current situation at any time. The risk reports are intended to be read by . the Executive Board of Vossloh AG as well as the management of the Group companies and business units. . These are responsible for managing and monitoring risks and opportunities. The management of the . business units, Controlling and the Vossloh Executive Board discuss the current risk situation on a regular . basis. The tight-knit personnel structure enables information to flow quickly and reactions to be invoked at . short notice. The Executive Board has adopted suitable measures in order to promptly identify developments . that may jeopardize the Group’s standing as a going concern. Internal Audit checks whether the risk and . opportunity management system is adequate and functional and whether it is in compliance with statutory . requirements on an annual basis.

These can . be caused by unexpected technical difficulties, unforeseeable developments at project sites, problems with . partners or subcontractors and logistical challenges, as well as delays in approvals, acceptance and billing. . Finalizing the sale of the Transportation division significantly reduced the risks related to order handling. . However, increased risks can occur during the start-up phase and implementation of major projects with . correspondingly high development costs or in cases of first-time collaboration with new partners or . subcontractors, leading to significant additional expenditure or contractual penalties. These risks can be . limited, but not fully eliminated, by formulating contracts appropriately and ensuring that project and . quality management are thorough. On the other hand, there may be isolated indirect opportunities if the . recognized risk provisions do not need to be fully utilized."

The goodwill of acquired companies is not amortized in accordance . with IFRS 3 in conjunction with IAS 36. Instead, this goodwill undergoes impairment testing each year as  . of the balance sheet date. Vossloh also carries out impairment testing during the year if exceptional events . occur. This testing involves a comparison of the relevant carrying amount of a group of cash-generating . units (CGUs) in relation to the goodwill of acquired companies against the value in use. An impairment test . was performed during the year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to an impairment test on . the balance sheet date.

Therefore, Vossloh was only slightly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic comparatively in the . 2020 fiscal year. Nevertheless, further unexpected effects in the 2021 fiscal year cannot be completely ruled . out. Of greater importance for Vossloh is the increasing demand for improved sustainability and the increasing . stature of rail as a means of transport and associated subsidy programs. This trend is expected to result in . an increased level of investment in rail infrastructure. On the other hand, an increase in the debt of individual . countries, particularly in the home market of Europe, may have a negative impact on Vossloh’s business . activities. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the debts of European countries increased significantly in the . 2020 fiscal year.

The most recent study was presented in October 2020. Due to the uncertainty . of COVID-19’s long-term impact on the rail industry, the study includes a scenario analysis that is alternatively . based on a V-shaped and U-shaped pattern of future market development. In the V-shaped pattern, the . market is expected to recover quickly, while in the U-shaped pattern, a longer recovery phase is assumed.  . In the study, the V-shaped pattern is assumed to be the most likely scenario to occur. The reasons cited for . this include the large number of economic stimulus packages and public aid for the rail sector as well as a . survey of UNIFE members. Therefore, the V-shaped pattern is discussed in more detail below. It includes all . known COVID-19-related issues, such as a reduction in volume in the service market and already-known . project postponements and cancellations. Looking at 2020, the study expects a significant decline in market . volume of 8 percent. Despite the decline in this submarket, the annual global volume for the overall rail . technology market is expected to grow from an average of €177 billion between 2017 and 2019 to an . average of around €204 billion between 2023 and 2025 – an average growth rate of 2.3 percent per year. . The market accessible to European providers such as Vossloh in the future is estimated by UNIFE to be . worth approximately €126 billion between 2023 and 2025. Accessible markets refers to the markets that are . available to European suppliers and non-European markets where demand is not exclusively met by . domestic capacity. For markets that can only be addressed by European suppliers via joint venture structures, . half of the market volume is classified as accessible.

81,0.125,"The Group Executive Board regularly deals with nonfinancial matters used by Vossloh to meet its environ-. mental, economic, and social responsibility. In operational management, sustainability is the responsibility . of the Chief Operation Officer (COO). In the year under review, Vossloh completed a multi-year phase of . restructuring and focusing on rail infrastructure. At the end of 2020, the Executive Board and Supervisory . Board of Vossloh AG adopted a revised corporate strategy in which sustainability is one of the central . initiatives. The high priority given to this issue is reflected in the accelerated development of a Group-wide . sustainability strategy among other things. For this purpose, the new central area of Sustainability,  . Health & Safety was created at Vossloh AG as of July 1, 2020. The head of this area, who was appointed on . November 1, 2020, reports directly to the Executive Board. The Sustainability, Health & Safety Committee . was also newly created. This is made up of the heads of certain Vossloh AG departments together with the . HSE (Health/Safety/Environment) officers of the business units. Employees responsible for sustainability, . health & safety were appointed in each business unit; previously, the topic had been located in the Group-. wide sustainability working group. At present, Group-wide working, reporting, managing and decision-. making structures for sustainability are being revised. This will put more focus on sustainability, both . strategically and operationally, and refine responsibilities and processes."
81,0.25,"The new structure will systematically bring together the company‘s existing approaches to managing the . environment, energy and occupational health and safety, standardize them in an integrated management . system and develop them into a Group-wide sustainability strategy. It will include mandatory, measurable . targets for all divisions, also defined in terms of scope and time frame, for matters deemed to be material. . On this basis, measures and activities can then be developed to achieve the desired goals. Vossloh aims to . achieve climate neutrality in Europe by 2030 in the categories of scope 1 (direct emissions from the combustion . of fossil fuels for heating and mobility) and scope 2 (indirect emissions caused by purchased electricity)."
81,0.375,"Vossloh’s sustainability performance has been assessed for many years by various rating agencies, which . provide recommendations for investment decisions. Among other things, Vossloh currently has Prime status . according to ISS ESG for meeting demanding requirements, and has been awarded an AA by MSCI, which is . the second-best rating. One criterion for such ratings is certification in accordance with internationally . recognized norms and standards. In recent years, more and more Vossloh units have been awarded . certification in at least one of the international quality, environmental, energy efficiency or social standards . such as ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 50001, OHSAS 18001 or its successor standard ISO 45001 or a comparable . national standard and have corresponding management systems in place. At the reporting date December 31, . 2020, more than 98 percent of the Vossloh workforce was employed at a unit with such certification."

To achieve this, the company strives . to constantly optimize the relevant processes and structures. This applies to the manufacture of rail . infrastructure products as well as the provision of rail track services. Environmental officers have been . appointed in the Group companies and a corresponding report system has been put in place. At the reporting . date December 31, 2020, approximately 72 percent of the Vossloh workforce was employed at a unit with . ISO 14001 certification."
83,0.11764705882352942,"All Vossloh companies have set a goal for themselves of using natural resources responsibly and sparingly. . Material consumption and disposal quantities are recorded and monitored in the individual units. Vossloh . units use safe disposal methods that are separated according to waste types. The selected waste manage-. ment companies are then reviewed regularly. Where it is technically possible and practical, closed material . life cycles and reprocessing plans reduce the consumption of valuable new raw materials such as fresh  . water to a minimum. Recycling is becoming increasingly important in a greater number of production areas. . Economically viable recycling programs and processes ensure that the amount of waste ultimately sent  . to landfill sites is steadily on the decline. Vossloh Tie Technologies, for example, recycles steel scrap and . process water on a large scale. Downcycling can also be a way to extend the lifecycle of the material. . At Vossloh Rail Services, for example, nonreprocessable residue from grinding stones is used as an additive . in slag production."
83,0.23529411764705885,"In its materiality analysis, Vossloh identified climate-relevant carbon emissions, noise emissions and . additionally water consumption as relevant nonfinancial performance indicators relating to the environment. . In all three areas, Vossloh has been striving for years to steadily reduce emissions and consumption. The . definition of concrete targets for fixed periods is one of the responsibilities of the new central Sustainability, . Health & Safety area. In 2020, temporary factory shutdowns and production cutbacks at various sites as  . well as working from home offices due to the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the company’s CO2-related energy . consumption and water consumption."
83,0.17647058823529413,"With regard to the impact on climate change, carbon emissions and carbon equivalents are relevant to . Vossloh. These are generated by the energy consumption of the company itself or in the upstream or . downstream areas. All the Vossloh divisions have been making targeted investments to reduce energy . consumption and boost energy efficiency for years, such as by switching to LED technology for its lighting.  . A number of production sites use waste heat from production. The “Factory of the Future” at Vossloh . Fastening Systems in Werdohl and the new “OT 2020” foundry at Vossloh Cogifer in Outreau are regarded . throughout the Group as flagship projects in terms of energy-efficient production."

These also include small changes such as orienting the fleet on low-carbon vehicles. Employees of the German . Vossloh companies are encouraged to use the train for business trips; frequent travelers can receive a business . rail card (“Bahncard Business”). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, travel in the Group decreased by a total of . about 65 percent in 2020."
84,0.17647058823529413,"At Vossloh Fastening Systems, the lighting in both the production spaces and the administration building at . the site in Poland was converted to energy-saving LEDs in 2020. The new compressor in the cooling system . and the new control cabinets also require less energy than the previous models. The plant in Anyang, China, . now uses excess steam from neighboring companies instead of producing it itself in natural gas-fired boilers. . At Vossloh Tie Technologies, the conversion of lighting to LED and the replacement of compressors in . ventilation systems also reduced energy consumption. Customized Modules is gradually equipping its sites . with charging stations for electric cars to promote the use of these vehicles. The Vossloh Switch Systems . technology center in Reichshoffen now covers its hot water needs with the help of solar collectors on the roof. . Lifecycle Solutions converted the last of its welding plants, Nuremberg, to green power in 2020. The conversion . to LED lighting was also continued there. The mobile service business of Vossloh Rail Services involves a lot of . unavoidable employee business travel. However, the company does encourage its employees to make their . travel activities energy-efficient, for example to ensure that they drive in a fuel-efficient manner when using . their cars."
84,0.11764705882352942,"In 2020, the example of a call for tenders for the supply of switches in the Netherlands showed how much . attention customers are now paying to ensuring that rail infrastructure products they install have the smallest . possible environmental footprint. The Environmental Cost Indicator (ECI) of the switches offered played a . decisive role in the award decision. The ECI includes energy consumption and CO2 emissions during production . as well as the results of a life cycle analysis (LCA). The Vossloh switches performed best in the ECI evaluation, . which is why the company was able to secure a multi-year framework agreement."
84,0.05882352941176471,"When manufacturing its products and providing its services, Vossloh aspires to comply with the legal . requirements applicable at the respective locations with regard to noise emissions. The products and . services of Vossloh, however, serve the purposes of creating and maintaining rail infrastructure. For rail . routes of all types, noise protection is a key subject of public perception and currently counts among the . most pressing challenges of rail transport. Noise hampers the urgently needed expansion of routes, can . cause sickness among people living near rail routes and results in high costs for the transport operators and . consumers. An essential factor in effective noise reduction is combating it at the source, by optimizing the . wheel-rail contact on the track. Reducing the noise caused by rail traffic and improving track acoustics have . been a focus of Vossloh’s research and development work for years (see also “Research and development”"

85,0.2,"on page 63). The Company offers suitable products and services in all divisions that can reduce rail noise  . on a sustainable basis. Examples are the cellentic components and rail fastening systems with a high plastic . content that dampen structure-borne noise, called whisper switches, and rail machining technologies . (grinding, milling) for restoring a smooth and therefore “quiet” surface. The rail and switch processing . machinery can achieve noise reduction of up to 10 dB(A) by precisely removing material. The machines . themselves also operate quietly. The Multi Purpose Milling (MPM) compact milling machine, for example, . generates noise measuring less than 78 dB(A) during operation, so that residents are not disturbed even . during a night shift. For comparison, on a quiet residential street, the noise level is roughly 40 dB(A); a car . going 50 km/h reaches a volume of 70 dB(A)."
85,0.3,"In Vossloh factories, water is mainly used for surface treatment of products, as a coolant in various . production processes and for the production of concrete ties. Vossloh units obtain the water from the . respective local public water supply systems. The company intends to use this basic resource as efficiently . as possible. As such, used water is reprocessed in our own plants and returned to the operating process, . particularly in production areas that require a substantial amount of water. In some cases, the production . units work with closed water circuits. At all of its sites, Vossloh disposes of wastewater via the respective . public sewage systems. Process water that is heavily contaminated during production is first treated in our . own wastewater treatment plants in such a way that it (at least) meets the discharge standards of the . public systems."

86,0.5,"Workplace safety and maintaining the employees’ health are at the heart of Vossloh’s care obligations as an . employer. Nearly all major production plants worldwide are certified under the internationally-recognized . standard OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series) or the successor standard  . ISO 45001, and undergo the prescribed audits by independent external auditors. As of the end of 2020,  . over 76 percent of Vossloh employees were employed at units certified in accordance with OHSAS 18001  . or ISO 45001. For the top managers of the operating units, achievement of the defined occupational safety . performance indicators is an integral part of their pay-related target agreements."
86,0.125,"There has been a permanent Group-wide occupational safety body since 2012 in the form of the Work Safety . Committee. This has initiated important steps to harmonize the occupational safety conditions across the . various divisions in recent years. For example, a standard occupational safety policy has been developed . which is mandatory for all companies around the world. In this policy, the zero-accident strategy vision is . defined. In 2020, the Work Safety Committee was intensively involved in the development of the Group’s own . SAFE+ app for reporting safety risks and mitigating moments of danger. It was also permanently involved in . the planning and management of measures to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic from March onwards."
86,0.625,"The COVID-19 pandemic also presented Vossloh with special challenges in the past year with regard to . protecting the health of its employees. The Company’s COVID-19 crisis team, consisting of the Chief  . Operating Officer, the Head of Corporate Human Resources, the Head of Corporate Controlling and the  . HSE managers of all business units, received all information from the Vossloh units on suspected and . confirmed COVID-19 cases. Together with the Groups Works Council, local employee representatives and  . the Work Safety Committee, it developed comprehensive protection and precautionary measures for the . workforce. Measures were promptly readjusted as needed. A newsletter regularly informed employees  . and repeatedly raised awareness of appropriate pandemic behavior."
86,0.375,"China was the first country to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The management of the Vossloh  . plants there took extensive measures to protect employees before resuming operations at the beginning  . of February 2020. After the pandemic spread to Europe, on March 2, 2020, all Vossloh employees were . instructed to observe distancing and hygiene rules and to avoid travel and in-person meetings. As of March . 17, up to 70 percent of employees in administrative areas were working from home offices. They were able . to access psychological care if needed and were given in-depth information about the dangers posed by . hacking activities. For communicating and working with each other, Vossloh IT rolled out the MS Teams tool. . Contact with customers, suppliers and service providers was also preferably kept online."
86,0.25,"When problems in the procurement of masks and infrared thermometers occurred at several European sites . at the beginning of the pandemic, Chinese Vossloh employees ensured that these supplies were delivered by . ship. Following government lockdown orders, a total of 12 Vossloh factories worldwide had to be shut down . for an average of about two and a half weeks in spring 2020. This meant that throughout the Group, Vossloh . plants stopped for a total of more than 160 work days due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The lockdowns ordered . in the fall of 2020 did not result in any plant shutdowns or production cutbacks. For the administrative staff, . Vossloh switfly extended the home office phase until March 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, 195 COVID-19 . cases were reported in the Group worldwide; all affected individuals have recovered. There was no indication . in follow-ups that an employee had become infected in the company."
86,0.75,"At Vossloh, workplace accidents throughout the Group have been documented every month on the basis of . uniform criteria, over and above what is required by law. The most important key performance indicators . here are the globally used metrics of lost time accident frequency rate (LTAFR) and lost time accident severity . rate (LTASR). Accidents resulting in lost time due to an employee’s ill health are immediately reported . directly to the Executive Board. The Work Safety Committee, the Group Works Council and the new .

87,0.3846153846153846,"Preventing possible accidents was the focus of activities by Vossloh Fastening Systems at the two Chinese . production sites in 2020. In Kunshan, the loading station for forklift trucks was separated from the production . area to minimize the risk of fire. In addition, storage facilities with liquefied gas tanks and cylinders were . structurally improved and the area surrounding a boiler heater with liquefied natural gas was upgraded in . terms of safety. The plant in Anyang has only been part of the Group since August 2019. The approach to . safety standards that is customary to Vossloh was introduced there in 2020 following the preparation of a . corresponding report by independent experts. Among other things, the accident prevention regulations . were updated and implemented in training courses for employees. Vossloh Tie Technologies also revised and . standardized all safety regulations. In addition, more training sessions were held at the plants in Australia, . which have been part of the Group since late 2018. At Vossloh Switch Systems, the forge in Rumelange, . Luxembourg was the focus in 2020. In a four-week intensive workshop, employees dealt with various . aspects of operational safety and identified starting points for improvement. In 2020, Vossloh Rail Services . continued the five-point program which had been initiated the previous year to reduce the frequency of . accidents. In addition to the measures implemented throughout the Group, it includes the introduction of . new safety footwear with ankle protection to prevent sprains in the foot area, the continuation of group . bonuses for accident-free work and a doubling of bonuses for improvements in occupational safety . implemented as part of the Company suggestion system."

Proper implementation of these measures is closely monitored and evaluated by the  . HR departments. As a key management tool, the yearly performance reviews entail not only such development . measures, but also mutual feedback from the manager and the employee regarding working together and . agreement on goals for a defined period of time. For nontariff employees, Vossloh has the People Review . Process (PRP) where goals are discussed. In the past fiscal year, more than 70 percent of nontariff employees . went through this process. The process, which was previously exclusively paper based, was digitalized in 2020. .

As a result of the COVID-19 . pandemic, there was a strong focus on training in online and blended learning formats in 2020. Overall, . online and blended learning training has nearly doubled compared to 2019. However, since not all classroom . training content could be immediately digitally implemented, not all employee training requests could be . fulfilled in 2020. Vossloh also supports employees gaining qualifi-cations on their own initiative, such as by . studying alongside working. In addition, there is a cross-business unit LEAD! Program, which prepares . high-potential employees for more advanced duties. The measures planned for 2020 had to be postponed . to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a virtual Alumni Conference organized by former LEAD! . participants encouraged the exchange of experiences.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, all current training . was maintained in 2020 and new training relationships were also started.

Key issues in this regard are equal opportunity, fair remuneration, . additional company benefits (above and beyond the statutory and/or tariff-based arrangements), and a safe . work environment. Adherence to local laws and standards (for example, minimum wage or fundamental . labor law conditions) is an integral part of Vossloh’s compliance obligations. The European Works Council, . the Group Works Council, the Executive Board and Corporate Human Resources regularly communicate at . Vossloh in order to guarantee the flow of information, discuss scope for improvements, address new issues . together and tackle these in projects. In 2020, the Group Works Council and Corporate HR Learning & . Development developed a diversity and inclusion policy for Vossloh. The working group was part of a joint . initiative from Human Resources and the Groups Work Council in connection with the “Work and Family” . certification, which Vossloh successfully completed in 2019. In addition, in the wake of the COVID-19 . pandemic and based on extensive experience with working from home, a Group company agreement on . mobile working was drawn up and adopted in 2020."

The instruments range from flexible working hours, flextime, part-time and parental leave models to mobile . working, personal sabbaticals, childcare and care support services as well as the conversion of bonus . payments into free time for the family. Arrangements are in place at Vossloh’s companies in France to . ensure the (un)availability of employees for work during their leisure time. The Customized Modules division . is also involved in the French “All on track” initiative for promoting diversity in the Company. Vossloh .

89,0.14285714285714288,"Issues that further strengthen Vossloh’s sustainability orientation are also incorporated into the Company’s . incentive system. A continuous improvement process (CIP), which is not yet centralized, is in place in a . number of business units. Vossloh employees participate financially from the savings that result from the . implementation of their ideas. The suggestions for improvement relate in part to product, process and . service quality and in part to occupational health and safety as well as environmental protection (with a . focus on resource conservation and energy saving). In the production of cellentic intermediate plates and . layers, for example, two improvements at once have resulted in more efficient utilization of the high-quality . starting material EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber). Around 3 to 5 percent of the blanks . coming out of the converter do not meet the specified standards. Previously, they had been transported . back to the supplier of the starting material and recycled there. In the first step, Vossloh employees found  . a way to rework these blanks themselves and feed them back into the forming process. In the second step, . a machine was converted in such a way that this recirculation no longer has to be carried out manually,  . but rather takes place automatically."

Beyond the obvious need to comply with applicable legal provisions, . Vossloh shares the security objectives pursued by foreign trade legislation, especially the strengthening of . international peace efforts and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. An export control . policy for the entire Group and which is based on applicable law creates a binding framework for the entire . Vossloh Group and all its employees to ensure compliance with the respective legal requirements. The . framework requirements of this policy are supplemented by more extensive regulations in the form of work . and organizational instructions, process descriptions, etc. The policy states that each operational unit  . must appoint an Export Officer and a Trade Compliance Officer (TCO). In cooperation with the respective  . HR departments, they develop training concepts and ensure that all employees working in areas relevant to . foreign trade receive the appropriate training. Vossloh’s central compliance e-learning tool also includes  . the module “Foreign trade law.”"

The new data protection policy . came into effect in May 2018. It is binding for all Vossloh companies and all staff worldwide, even outside . the European Union.

96,0.28571428571428575,"As a globally acting Group, Vossloh actively promotes diversity within its workforce. In 2020, the Company . employed men and women from over 45 countries and with a wide range of qualification levels, education . levels, vocational training paths, career experience and service years within all of its hierarchical levels. . Vossloh is fundamentally committed to promoting equal opportunities in the workplace, such as in the . selection of employees for high-potential programs or recruitment for open positions, as well as part of its . HR policy focusing on life phases. In the Customized Modules division, the “All on track” initiative that was . launched in 2019 is having an impact, but was only able to implement part of its planned activities due to  . the COVID-19 pandemic. The network for more diversity and especially more women in the workforce is now . actively supported by 35 people in six countries. The initiative was given a boost by the fact that French  . companies with more than 50 employees are obliged to publish annual figures on equality between men and . women in the workplace. In this Penicaud index, Vossloh Cogifer SA achieved 85 out of a possible 100 points . in 2020. The French Vossloh sites also participate in the nationwide TREMPLIN initiative (translated: . springboard; abbreviation for TRansport EMPLoi INnovation). It aims to reduce the shortage of skilled . workers in the transport and logistics industry by encouraging and promoting applications from people  . with disabilities."
96,0.42857142857142855,"To minimize the risk of child labor, Vossloh, as a rule, does not employ anyone under the age of 14 or 15 . (depending on the legal provisions in the different countries). In addition, the majority of Vossloh’s production . facilities are located in Europe. Employees under the age of 18 are usually apprentices. The instructors . responsible for them are duty-bound to observe all the relevant labor law and occupational safety rules and . provisions. A whistleblower hotline is available in order for possible misconduct to be reported. No human . rights violations were reported in the 2020 fiscal year (2019: also no reports)."
96,0.5714285714285715,"There are no Company-wide specifications in place at Vossloh regarding the aspect of human rights when . drawing up contracts and there is therefore no monitoring of this. More recent major partnership contracts . such as joint venture agreements generally already include the Vossloh Code of Conduct and therefore also . its human rights aspects as mandatory conduct rules. The same applies to contracts with intermediaries  . (e.g. commercial agents and distributors)."
96,0.7142857142857143,"To date, neither Vossloh’s own sites nor its suppliers have been subject to checks of their compliance with . the human rights clauses, and corresponding monitoring and assessment processes have not been established. . The various Vossloh companies subject their suppliers and intermediaries to intensive preliminary checks . before concluding a contract with them. Here the Company has so far not had cause to check compliance . with human rights."

96,0.14285714285714288,"The rail infrastructure markets in which Vossloh operates have a number of particular characteristics. These . are the result of the historic development of rail as a means of transportation, among other things. In the . majority of these markets, the rail infrastructure and numerous rail transport operators are still state-owned. . Vossloh’s potential customers are therefore companies the investment scope of which can also be influenced . by political specifications. Building and maintaining rail routes and purchasing and maintaining the rail . vehicles are costly as rail transport operators are required to comply with extensive technical, logistical and . legal provisions. The number of potential Vossloh customers is therefore limited. Furthermore, safety is . elementary when it comes to the (mass) transportation of people and goods. Rail performs well in this . respect compared to other modes of transport. The safety of its products and services and customer . satisfaction are therefore key nonfinancial performance indicators for Vossloh. The material nonfinancial . risks that the Company faces because of the underlying industry conditions or the markets it develops are . covered in the section entitled “Nonfinancial risks and opportunities” on page 73."

97,0.25,"Vossloh makes considerable contributions to the safety of rail services, meeting the most stringent  . of standards itself in the process. Vossloh’s products and services are subject to detailed technical  . specifications and standards that must be met. All the main production plants have quality management  . in accordance with ISO 9001 or a comparable national standard like the AAR’s M1003 standard in the USA. . At the reporting date December 31, 2020, around 97 percent of the Vossloh workforce was employed at a . unit with such a certification. The products and services generally undergo thorough testing that often lasts . for years before they are applied to the tracks. This is performed on the Company’s own test benches and in . its own testing laboratories, with test installations/test usage by the customers and as part of the complex . approval process of certified testing organizations. In 2020, for example, the Core Components division also . tested the innovative EPS composite tie in regular operation on selected routes. The Customized Modules . division tested further products made from its extremely hard rolled steel CogX. The Lifecycle Solutions . division continued with the HavenZuG project – together with some renowned partners. The focus of this . project is on investigating how the permanent monitoring and analysis of the condition of port railway . tracks can be incorporated into daily shunting operations. The stringent requirements result in lengthy  . development times. All of Vossloh’s business units have their own Research and Development departments, . which are staffed by highly specialized professionals (see the “Research & Development” chapter from . page 63)."

These are chosen by the individual operating units with their specific expertise.  . The extensive evaluations and audits of both potential and existing suppliers are based on numerous . criteria. A key aspect is a supplier’s unfailing ability to meet the quality standards stipulated by Vossloh.  . The keywords here include product quality, service and delivery reliability. All of Vossloh’s partners are . regularly assessed on the basis of fixed aspects, in particular concerning quality. Contracts are only awarded . to companies on the list of approved suppliers. Vossloh suppliers must be generally able to guarantee at all . times that their goods and services meet the applicable regulatory and statutory requirements."

Since February 2018, a uniform CRM (customer relationship management) software program . has been rolled out across the Group. This software makes all information on all Vossloh customers . available to all operating units centrally, in a secure environment, and at the same time records all rail . infrastructure projects worldwide. In 2020, enhancements were developed for CRM, primarily to make it . even more user friendly and optimize offer processing. The current version of CRM (Business Release II) . went online in January 2021. The most important new feature is the request that sales employees assess . customer satisfaction using a 5-star scale. Business Release III will be launched during 2021. This version . surveys customer satisfaction using specific questions associated with customer groups, resulting in an . overall score. To objectify this assessment, direct customer surveys and analyses will be conducted regularly . in the future by means of the marketing tool that was also added to CRM in 2020. This is based on various . segmentation criteria (regions, customer categories, customer classifications, service segments) and the . division into buying center functions."
97,0.625,"Vossloh Fastening Systems is a pioneer in the permanent registration of customer satisfaction. Starting in . 2020, five relevant questions had to be answered for each customer visit report, either together with the . customer or as an assessment by the sales employee.

However, the impact was relatively low compared to companies in other sectors.  These two . main factors reduced sales revenues by around €90 million. We expect EBIT to fall by around €25 million . due to the pandemic. The main factors affecting our future performance will be the pace at which  . vaccinations can be rolled out in different countries and regions, as well as what further impact the . pandemic will have on the economy in our main sales markets – particularly in light of how new variants  . are currently driving up infection rates. We analyze all risks relevant to our business on an ongoing basis  . in order to ensure that we are able to take any appropriate action at short notice."
110,0.2777777777777778,"Preparing the consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain discretionary . decisions, assumptions and estimates. These estimates involve a certain level of uncertainty. They affect the . valuation of recognized assets, liabilities and of contingent liabilities as of the balance sheet date, as well . as the recognition of income and expenses in the reporting period."
110,0.1111111111111111,"Due to uncertainty, the actual values subsequently determined may differ from those estimates and hence . from the amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. The estimates and underlying . assumptions are subject to ongoing review. Adjustments are made in the period of the change or in future . periods, for example in the case of changes to the useful lives of property, plant and equipment."
110,0.4444444444444444,"Estimation uncertainty with a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements is particularly . prevalent when accounting for goodwill (see Note 10), recognizing deferred taxes (see Note 16) and . recognizing and measuring other provisions (see Note 25)."

This involves offsetting the cost of the acquired . shares against the Group’s holding in the equity of the subsidiaries. To determine the equity of subsidiaries . acquired upon initial consolidation, all identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the . subsidiary are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Remaining positive differences between the . purchase price and the market value of the acquired assets and liabilities are recognized as goodwill in . accordance with IFRS 3 and are tested for impairment annually at the level of the relevant business unit. . Negative goodwill is directly recognized in profit after the fair values of assets and liabilities have been . reassessed. Shares belonging to other investors with a corresponding stake in the identifiable net assets of . the respective company acquired are measured at the acquisition date.

Vossloh holds 51 percent of the shares in this company. The joint . venture was founded together with a partner in the 2019 fiscal year with the objective of bundling the . production of specific components of rail fastening systems in order to generate cost benefits. Against the . backdrop of a number of relevant decisions in the start-up year, it was already contractually agreed at the . time of the company’s establishment that significant decisions over the course of 2019 would be made . jointly, but that control would be transferred to Vossloh at the beginning of 2020 through the amendment of . the corresponding provisions on unanimity requirements in the case of matters involving significant decisions."

The . resulting expenses mainly led to the impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, in . addition to termination payments and related payments. Impairments in the previous year related to the . divestment of unprofitable or disadvantageous activities came to €41.9 million. The expenses related to . reducing the number of employees came to €30.2 million, divided between termination payments and . provisions for such payments. Additional expenses of €21.2 million were mostly recognized in the cost of . sales, in addition to further impairments of trade receivables under general administrative and selling . expenses. One-time effects in the previous year led to expenses of €93.3 million in the income statement. . Subsequent effects and reversal effects took the form of income from the reversal of staff-related provisions . (€3.3 million) and expenses from the divestment of unprofitable activities (€4.9 million). These effects . netted out to €(1.6) million in the year under review, and had little impact on the consolidated financial . statements."

116,0.2,"The performance obligations of Group companies consist primarily of the delivery of typical products or the . rendering of services, which are listed in the description of the business activities of the divisions and . business units in the notes to the segment report on pages 144 et seq. Sales revenues are recognized net  . of sales deductions and price allowances such as discounts, bonuses, rebates, and purchases or returns . credited. As a general rule, in accordance with IFRS 15, recognition takes place upon transfer of control of . the products to be delivered on the basis of the respective contractually agreed incoterms. In most cases, . this is covered by the transfer of ownership and risks to the buyer or when the customer takes physical . possession. At several Group companies, “bill-and-hold” arrangements have been contractually agreed . because the customers manage the delivery of products on the basis of their own planning of construction . projects in cases of new or overhauled rail routes. In such cases, the products have already been accepted . by the customer in advance and are also stored separately as the property of the customer. Where partial . invoices have been contractually agreed upon in advance, sales are recognized after the customer has . finally and formally accepted the partial delivery. The payment terms for the majority of customer contracts . do not include any financing components. Some orders include de facto redemption obligations for . individual components in the event that components need to be replaced with more suitable versions due . to specific effects. Contractual guarantees are also concluded on at arm’s length basis."
116,0.4,"For certain projects, the performance of the owed service and the associated revenue recognition take place . over a period of time. The same applies generally to the provision of services. In this context, the proportional . earnings contribution realized as of the reporting date is also recognized along with the revenue in the . income statement. The percentage of completion of the contracts is recognized using the percentage-of-. completion method (PoC) by comparing the contract costs already incurred with the total expected contract . costs. This process establishes the percentage of completion of the contracts based on the ratio of costs . already incurred to the estimated total contract costs (cost-to-cost method). Costs due to inefficiencies or . similar causes are deducted in the calculation of the percentage of completion. The proportional profit from . the PoC method is recognized only where the results of the customer contracts can be determined reliably.  . If this condition is not met, sales are recognized without including the proportional profit. Where a loss from . a customer contract is imminent, this is recognized in full."

124,0.375,"Pursuant to IFRS 3 in conjunction with IAS 36, goodwill from acquisitions is not amortized but is tested . annually for impairment as of the balance sheet date or upon the occurrence of triggering events. This . involves comparing the recoverable amount, calculated as value in use, to the respective carrying amount  . of a group of cash-generating units (CGUs). Within the Vossloh Group, goodwill is assigned to the business . units, which represent groups of CGUs. The impairment test is performed at this level. The value in use is . calculated based on the medium-term budget for the respective units and is derived from the expected . discounted cash flows. In this respect, key assumptions are the anticipated orders resulting from sales . planning, the corresponding expected sales revenues and the full earnings and balance sheet planning . based on this."
124,0.3125,"When measuring the value in use by discounting anticipated cash flows, a pre-tax discount rate specific to . the business unit is applied. When determining the respective discount rate, weighted specific country risks, . inflation effects and tax rates are considered, whereby the weightings from the country risks as well as the . inflation effects from the regional distribution of sales were derived from both the past fiscal year and over . the budget periods, while the tax rates were determined on the basis of the relative earnings contributions . of the companies within the business units."
124,0.1875,"The planning is based on empirical data and expected future market trends and encompasses a detailed . planning period of three years. The expected sales growth of the business units is based on the planned . projects and projects which are already included in the order backlog to various extents. Average annual . sales growth in the business units, which is anticipated for this period in line with the medium-term budget, . is reported in the table below. The growth rate of the perpetual annuity was set at 50 percent of the . business unit-specific inflation rate resulting from the discount factor calculation described above."
124,0.25,"For periods beyond this planning horizon, the cash flows are projected forward by assuming the described . growth rate to determine the value in use. An equal level of financing of inventories, trade receivables and . payables, and property, plant and equipment associated with this growth was also included in the cash . flow. As the business units’ values in use (including assigned goodwill) exceed their carrying amounts, no . goodwill impairment loss had to be recognized. Within the scope of sensitivity analyses, various scenarios . are examined: an increase in the discount rates by 50 basis points, a separate derivation of the WACC just . for the terminal value and a general reduction in cash flows by 7.5 percent. A need for impairment ranging . between €0.7 million and €3.0 million was identified in the first and third scenario for the Rail Services . business unit. The value in use of this business unit exceeds the carrying amount by €13.4 million.."

Contracts are remeasured in response to changes  . in their expected term and other estimates. The resulting changes in value are shown in the line item . “First-time application of IFRS 16 (2019) / remeasurements and modifications (2020)” in the table showing . changes in carrying amounts.

139,0.5882352941176471,"The recognized pension provisions and the provisions for other post-employment benefits are derived  . as follows:"
139,0.29411764705882354,"The current service cost represents a portion of the personnel expense that is included in the functional . costs. Interest expense is shown in other interest expense. The actual return on plan assets amounted  . to 3.5 percent in the reporting period (previous year: 3.7 percent)."
139,0.17647058823529413,"A discount rate of 0.78 percent (previous year: 1.16 percent) was used in the year under review. This . parameter is seen as significant; for this reason, a sensitivity analysis was performed due to possible . changes. A decrease or increase in the discount rate by 25 basis points would have increased or decreased . the defined benefit obligation (DBO) and therefore increased the provision by €1.7 million (previous year: . €1.5 million) or decreased the provision by €1.7 million (previous year: €1.4 million). The average duration  . of the defined benefit pension plans is 15.3 years. Other parameters include the anticipated staff turnover . (6.0 percent), income trend (3.0 percent), pension trend (1.8 percent) and the anticipated increase in the . contribution measurement threshold (2.5 percent) (all values are per annum and unchanged over the . previous year)."
139,0.4705882352941177,"In addition, voluntary or statutory defined contribution plans are in place at a number of Group companies. . These Group companies are not normally under any obligation to make pensions-related payments other . than their contractual contributions to an outside fund, which totaled €7.2 million in the fiscal year . (previous year: €8.2 million)."
139,0.11764705882352942,"The pension provisions include provisions for nonrecurring payments (“indemnités de fin de carrière”) . which are a legal requirement for a number of Group companies (particularly those in France) for employees . who leave the Company (both in the case of retirement as well as other situations). In accordance with IAS 19, . such provisions are required to be treated as employee benefits and, because of the way they have been . structured, classified as a “defined benefit plan“. Obligations of this nature from other Group companies . were recognized as other provisions in previous years. A €1.6 million adjustment was therefore made to the . previous year’s figures for provisions for other post-employment benefits and other noncurrent provisions."
139,0.35294117647058826,"Assets have partially been set up in an external benefit fund (“plan assets”) in order to finance the . expected payments. The provisions recognized on the balance sheet therefore constitute the total of the  . fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the obligation."
139,0.23529411764705885,"When calculating the provision, a discount rate of 0.59 percent (previous year: 0.77 percent) and an . expected increase of wage and salary payments in line with the previous year of 2.0 percent was assumed."

In April 2019, the volume of the loan was increased by . €80 million to €230 million. If necessary, it can be increased by up to a further €70 million during the term . of the loan. The funds are available to the Company in the form of a revolving line of credit that can be . flexibly accessed. Compliance with a covenant in the form of the ratio of net financial debt to EBITDA was . agreed here. If the agreed threshold of this key figure is breached, this will allow the lending banks to . terminate the agreement ahead of time. At the same time, the amount of the key figure in question . determines the interest (basis points above Euribor). This is currently 1.50 percent. As of the balance sheet . date, the credit line had been utilized in the amount of €85.9 million via cash, lines of credit available to . subsidiaries, and guarantees (previous year: €102.3 million).

Significant . operations-related currency risks Vossloh is exposed to originate from trade receivables and payables . denominated in a noneuro currency, as well as from pending or uncompleted trade and purchasing trans-. actions. Vossloh has issued binding instructions to centrally hedge against currency risks Group-wide . through Treasury Management by using foreign currency forwards at matching maturities and amounts as . micro hedges of the associated underlying transactions. The fixed exchange rates for the hedged underlying . transactions counter any unfavorable rate effects on cost estimates and assets. As of the reporting date, . Vossloh had €0.1 million in currency derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge. All other currency . derivatives are freestanding. The translation of foreign separate financial statements into the Group currency, . the euro, results in currency translation differences (translation risks) which are recognized directly in the . “Accumulated other comprehensive income” balance sheet item (see “Currency translation” on page 115). . Income, expenses and carrying values of companies that are not based in the eurozone are thus dependent . on the respective euro exchange rate. Translation risks are not currently hedged because they do not directly . affect cash flow. In addition, investments in foreign companies are typically long-term."
149,0.9166666666666667,"Interest rate risks mainly result from floating-rate short- and long-term loans raised for Group financing . purposes, as well as from short-term funds invested at variable rates."
149,0.33333333333333337,"The risk of an unfavorable market rate trend and thus higher interest payments for floating-rate notes is . contained by contracting interest rate swaps (see the glossary for these terms on page 173)."
149,0.41666666666666663,"In connection with hedge accounting, such interest rate hedging transactions are accounted for as cash . flow hedges.

The following changes have been assumed with regard to interest-rate . risk and exchange-rate risk:. -  an increase in market interest rates of 1 percent or a reduction in market interest rates of 0.25 percent  . (parallel shift in the yield curve);. - a simultaneous appreciation and depreciation of the euro against all foreign currencies by 10 percent."
149,0.25,"Financial instruments originally stipulated with variable interest rates as well as existing interest rate . derivatives were taken into consideration in the determination of the interest-rate risk as of the reporting . date. A market interest rate that is higher by 100 percentage points related to the financial liabilities and . receivables identified with variable rates as of December 31, 2020, would have increased the financial result . by €0.3 million. A market interest rate that was lower by 25 points would have reduced the net financial . result by €0.1 million owing to the existing Euribor floor rule in the syndicated loan. Equity would have been . €0.2 million lower at the higher market interest rate or €0.1 million lower at the lower market interest rate. .

The central Treasury department is tracking developments in this area and assessing agreements . which are affected. It is also responsible for managing the transition to alternative rates and making the . necessary amendments to agreements.

The nominal volume of the hedge  . due in 2026 was €9.0 million initially and was down to €7.1 million at the end of the year. An exemption is . being used for this hedge on the basis of the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 which the IASB . published on September 26, 2019. These amendments permit entities to continue to apply hedge accounting . even if the risk component (reference rate) is not separately identifiable on an ongoing basis.

IBOR Fallbacks Supplement and IBOR Fallbacks Protocol published by the International Swaps and Derivatives . Association (ISDA) in October 2020 into the framework agreement. The Supplement changes the ISDA’s . standard definitions for interest rate derivatives to include robust fallbacks for derivatives that are linked to . specific IBORs.

164,0.21428571428571427,"Within Vossloh Group, a distinction is made between four cash-generating units (CGUs), each of which is . allocated goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment (impairment test) annually as at the balance sheet . date or on related occasions. This impairment test is carried out by comparing the carrying amounts of the . cash-generating units with their respective recoverable amounts in order to determine any need for . impairment. The recoverable amount is determined on the basis of value in use taking into account the . medium-term budget of the respective unit using expected discounted cash flows (discounted cash flow . method)."
164,0.07142857142857144,"The cash flow forecasts are based on the group planning for a three-year detailed planning period that was . approved by the executive board, acknowledged by the supervisory board and which is applicable at the . time the impairment test is carried out. This also comprises expectations on the future development of the . market and country-specific assumptions on the development of macro-economic indicators. Planning . periods further in the future that account for a significant portion of value in use (period of perpetuity) are . included in the value in use by rolling forward of cash flows taking into account a CGU-specific growth rate. . Discounting is made using the weighted capital costs of the respective cash-generating unit."
164,0.5714285714285715,"The result of this valuation is highly dependent on the executive board’s assessment of the future cash  . flows and the discount rate used and, therefore, is subject to great uncertainty. Therefore, and due to the . complexity of the valuation of this high-amount item, this matter was of particular significance in the scope . of our audit."

164,0.14285714285714288,"b)  During our audit, we, among other things, obtained an understanding of the method applied in the . impairment test, estimated the determination of the weighted capital costs and assessed the calculation . method of the impairment test by consulting our valuation specialists. We examined the appropriateness . of the future cash flows used in the valuation, among other things, by comparing them with the current . planning prepared by the executive board and acknowledged by the supervisory board and by means of . questioning the executive board regarding the material planning assumptions. Moreover, we reviewed . the planning in a critical manner taking into account general and industry-specific market expectations."

165,0.1,"Together with the Parent’s representatives in charge, we thoroughly discussed and obtained an under-. standing of any incremental adjustments of the detailed planning period and the rolling forward of cash . flows for the period of perpetuity. .  . As already minor changes of the discount rate used may have material impacts on the amount of the . determined recoverable amount, we dealt in detail with the parameters used in determining the discount . rate used and obtained an understanding of the computation scheme. Furthermore, on account of the . material significance of goodwill for assets and liabilities of the Group, we performed additional own . sensitivity analyses in order to be able to assess any possible risk for impairment in the event of a potential . change in a key valuation assumption. In addition, we audited the completeness and appropriateness of . the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements required under IAS 36."
