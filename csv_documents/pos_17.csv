5,0.5,"Sustainable operations create competitive advantages, increase enterprise value and make for a stronger corporate . culture. Based on these convictions, the  INDUS Group continually works to optimize its commitment to sustainability."
5,0.75,"SUSTAINABILITY: FOR  INDUS, NOTHING NEW"
5,0.08333333333333334,"For us, the pursuit of sustainability is a matter of treating . economic, social and ecological goals as equal in importance. . We seek to create lasting value while facilitating good work . and treating the environment with care. It is our conviction . that our development is sustainable only if we are satisfying . the needs of the present while at the same time ensuring that . we are not doing so at the expense of the future."
5,0.41666666666666663,"The portfolio companies of the   INDUS Holding AG have in-. dependently assumed responsibility for pursuing a sustaina-. bility-oriented business development policy. They set inde-. pendent goals, develop action plans and evaluate their own . achievements. The holding company performs comprehen-. sive information work by collecting sustainability-related . data and forwarding it to Group companies to enable feed-. back on target attainment.  INDUS Holding AG also provides . advice to the portfolio companies as required, helping them . effectively improve their “sustainability balance”."
5,0.5833333333333334,"INDUS Holding AG’s tasks also include providing constant . assistance for the portfolio companies and acquiring new . portfolio companies. Thus the holding company acts as an . internal service provider for the portfolio companies. This . means the holding company’s resource consumption along . the value chain is restricted to acquisition, use and dispos-. al of energy, office materials and equipment, and any other . business equipment required."
5,0.25,"Reviewing relevant sustainability criteria in the value chain . falls under the operational responsibility of the portfolio . companies, however, each portfolio company joined the .  INDUS Group (hereafter also  INDUS) following a due dil-. igence process. The real net output ratio and the associated . sustainability risks are checked during this process. Innova-. tion results in new products, services and even approaches . for new business models, which in turn create competitive . advantages for our portfolio companies against their com-. petitors. The constant technological developments in man-. ufacturing processes at our portfolio companies and the . technological advances made by manufacturers in the manu-"
5,0.6666666666666667,"facture of machinery and plants increase the quality of prod-. ucts and lead to a reduction in the energy consumed, thereby . lowering both emissions and costs."
5,0.33333333333333337,"Ongoing and new measures to support the holding compa-. ny’s sustainability strategy will be detailed in the  following . chapters. Our work in the field of sustainability has met . with a positive response both in the business world and . in the capital market environment. This is also reflected in . the  corresponding sustainability ratings:  INDUS was again . awarded a top “A” grade in the CDP Climate Scoring in .  January 2019. And it retained its “Prime” status in the sus-. tainability ratings of ISS-oekom/oekom research AG."

5,0.16666666666666669,"The basis for successful work on sustainability issues, and . ultimately for long-term entrepreneurial success, is knowl-. edge of our stakeholders and their interests. Only with such . knowledge can we be assured of making the right decisions . and aligning our actions accordingly. A structured process . was applied to identify the main stakeholders. Potentially . relevant stakeholders were identified, for instance by look-. ing at the value chain, and prioritized based on their influ-. ence on the  INDUS Group and the influence of the  INDUS . Group on them. A structured examination of our stakehold-. ers’ needs brought five relevant groups into focus."

6,0.7857142857142857,"The holding company and the portfolio companies, where . appropriate, maintain regular contact with all five stakehold-. er groups. Various forms and channels of communication are . used. In the 2016 fiscal year, the fields of action and key top-. ics identified internally were compared with the opinion of . select portfolio companies in an informative discussion. In . fiscal year 2017, the stakeholder dialogue with institution-. al investors and interested owners of family-run businesses . was ramped up. Both stakeholder groups were questioned . on their views and perceptions of the  INDUS sustainability . strategy and sustainability reporting. One of the aims was to . verify the sustainability aspects identified as material dur-. ing prior analyses and observations. In the 2018 fiscal year, . the dialogue focused on the views of the internal stakehold-. er group “portfolio companies”. Managing directors of the . portfolio companies were surveyed to verify the complete-. ness of the fields of action currently being addressed, and to . assess the materiality of these fields. The materiality matrix . was revised as a result of this survey (see page 26)."

6,0.6428571428571429,"To identify those aspects of sustainability that are relevant . to  INDUS, we performed a materiality analysis in 2016 with . the Board of Management’s participation. Topics deemed . material are those that are very significant in terms of operat-. ing activities, business performance and income for  INDUS . and its internal and external stakeholders as far as sustainabil-. ity is concerned (outside-in view) or topics likely to impact . sustainability aspects through  INDUS’s operating activities"
6,0.7142857142857143,"(inside-out view). The results of this analysis were verified . during the course of the previously mentioned stakeholder . dialogue both from an external point of view (2017) as well . as an internal point of view (2018). We were also able to . confirm the seven key topics previously identified:"
6,0.8571428571428571,"1.  Investments: the use of economic resources to success-. fully develop the portfolio companies or the Group.. 2.  Innovation: the further development of the products and . services offered by the portfolio companies along with . the development of new, or even disruptive, solutions.. 3.  Internationalization: expansion of the portfolio compa-. nies (products, selling markets) into the relevant interna-. tional regions so that they can provide customer support . locally on a long-term basis.. 4.  INDUS Holding AG’s role as shareholder: financial and . advisory assistance from the holding company for the . portfolio companies in their efforts to develop their busi-. nesses within the existing range of possibilities.. 5.  Personnel: employees as a key driver of corporate de-. velopment at  INDUS Holding AG and the individual . portfolio companies.. 6.  Resource efficiency: taking ecological consequences . into account in business decisions and minimizing the . ecological effects of the portfolio companies’ operating . activities.. 7.  Social commitment: assuming the portfolio companies’ . and  INDUS Holding AG’s responsibility for social tasks."

This is true first and foremost of the use of raw and other . materials and, in a different form, of the use of energy and . disposal services.

18,0.5833333333333334,"The companies are at the same time subject to the ever more . stringent requirements of the environments in which they . operate; legislators are making the regulatory framework . ever tighter. Customers also wish for production methods . that conserve resources and products produced by them. . This partially results in some significant changes in the . framework conditions for the  INDUS Holding AG portfolio . companies. To determine and evaluate the resulting financial . risks,  INDUS Holding AG performed its first climate-related . scenario analysis in 2018, based on the recommendations . of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures . (TCFD)."
18,0.41666666666666663,"The aim of the climate-related scenario analysis was to ex-. amine the qualitative consequences of various scenarios on .  INDUS. Portfolio companies in the Automotive Technology . segment were given particular consideration in the scenar-. io analysis as this is where the greatest impacts from legis-. lation, technological developments (e. g. e-mobility) and . changing user behavior (e. g. car sharing) were expected. The . analysis made use of established scenarios from various or-. ganizations. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) 2DS . scenario formed the foundation for the analysis. It shows a . path for achieving the Paris Agreement’s 2-degree Celsius . target using industry sector decarbonization methods. With . the help of additional information from BDI (association of . the German industry), Greenpeace and BP scenario studies, . two consistent scenarios were developed with the observa-. tion points 2030 and 2050. An ambitious scenario in terms . of infrastructure expansion, technological development and . spread, and regulation, and a conservative scenario that as-. sumes virtually constant structures."
18,0.5,"For the relevant investment portfolio, opportunities pri-. marily arise from the ambitious scenario, for example from . e-mobility. Great potential arises particularly in cases where . portfolio companies offer energy-efficient technologies (e. g. . heat pumps from AURORA for electric buses). For some . portfolio companies that are heavily involved in the value . chain for conventional power trains, the developments and . spread of CO2-neutral fuels (synthetic, organic-based or H2) . are also decisive. Because the observation points of several . product life cycles lie in the future, the analysis of corre-. sponding developments in the automotive and transport . sector and improving  INDUS companies’ ability to adapt . to these developments is crucial.  INDUS Holding AG will . continue to support the portfolio companies in these tasks . in future."

We engage in an active risk . management process before we acquire a company, study-. ing not only the usual economic, technological and market- . related risks but also the risk situation in such fundamental . areas as the environment, employee concerns and compli-. ance issues."
24,0.5833333333333334,"Another important factor we consider for an acquisition is . reputation. The new company’s image, core business and . culture should add lasting value to the  INDUS Group and . have a positive effect on the attractiveness of  INDUS for in-. vestors and potential sellers of companies."
24,0.625,"In 2018, the portfolio company AURORA acquired .  ELECTRONIC  EQUIPMENT, a strategic second-level ad-. dition. Other strategic additions were the acquisition of a . retail company for medical aids by OFA and a manufacturer  . of air-conditioning devices by one of our other portfolio . companies. We invested in total EUR 11.5 million in com-. pany acquisitions. Another EUR 90.9 million was invested . in property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. The . acquisitions contributed 1.13% to our growth in sales."
24,0.875,"OUTLOOK"
24,0.6666666666666667,"In the 2019 fiscal year, we wish to successfully continue . the holding company’s acquisition strategy of the last sev-. eral years. That means the direct acquisition of two to three . growth companies by the holding company and up to four . companies at sub-subsidiary level. We have allocated an in-. vestment budget of not less than EUR 50 million for this. . As in the past, the new Group companies are expected to be . viably positioned for the long term in terms also of sustaina-. bility considerations."
