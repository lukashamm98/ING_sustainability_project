4,0.6,"1.1. KPI selection"
4,0.55,"KPI selected by the issuer"
4,0.45,"FROM ISSUER’S FRAMEWORK"
4,0.75,"• KPI: tCO2e/million R$ (net revenue) covering 100% of Movida operations and including Scopes 1, 2"
4,0.35,"and 3 emissions."
4,0.65,"• SPT: reduction of GHG emissions intensity to 45.37 or less tCO2e/million R$ by the end of 2025, which"
4,0.25,"is equivalent to an estimated reduction of 15% from the 2019 baseline."
4,0.8,". Associated long-term goal: Reduce GHG emissions intensity (tCO2e/million R$) by 30% (scopes 1, 2 and . 3 emissions) by the end of 2030, reaching an intensity level of 37.38 or less tCO2e/million R$ produced. . Rationale: The issuer states that the KPI selected is material and relevant for Movida. Due to the nature . of its business, the issuer concludes that the best option for their first SLB operation is to define an . intensity target, tracking the company's organic growth regarding its emissions reductions. Reducing . GHG emissions intensity is a key strategy for Movida to contribute to the achievement of global . sustainability goals and targets, mitigate climate change and address the climate crisis, while expanding . its potential for generating a positive impact."
4,0.7,"Movida´s Sustainability Performance Target was therefore established considering its direct emissions . (Scope 1), as well as its indirect emissions, related to the use of energy (Scope 2) and the material links . of its value chain (Scope 3), with the purpose of aligning the company's organic growth with emissions . reductions. Scope 3 emissions were strategically included in the scope of its reduction target because . this category represents 98% of the company's total emissions, according to its latest GHG Inventory . published and audited."
4,0.2,"Baseline: 53.38 tCO2e/million R$ *"
4,0.3,"Baseline year: 2019"
4,0.15,"2025 goal:  45.37 tCO2e/million R$"
4,0.85,"Scope: 100% of Movida operations, on GHG emissions scopes 1,2 and 3.   . *2019 was chosen as a baseline year because it was the year when Movida started to prepare its GHG . Inventory following the standards of The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: the Corporate Accounting and . Reporting Standard, WRI & WBCSD (2004) and Guides, Guidelines and Calculation tools of the Brazilian . GHG Protocol Program (PBGHGP) of FGV (2020). In addition to that, the 2019 GHG´s Inventory was the . first inventory audited by an independent third party in 2020. .  . KPI calculation methodology: Movida used its GHG emissions inventory methodology, that was built . following the guides, guidelines and calculation tools of the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program (2020)."

4,0.5,"2 The level of ambition against Movida’s past performance can only be partially judged due to the lack of historical data beyond 2019 and . 2020. Prior to this date, the inventory methodology was not aligned with the same accounting protocol and has not been verified. ."

5,0.4375,"Climate change mitigation is considered a key ESG issue faced by the Transport and Logistics sector . according to key ESG standards3 for reporting and ISS ESG assessment. As of 2020, transportation is . responsible for 24% of direct CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. Road vehicles – cars, trucks, buses . and two- and three-wheelers – account for nearly three-quarters of transport CO2 emissions."
5,0.6875,"Companies in the Transport and Logistics sector involved in road transport for passengers are highly . energy-intense in the operations of their fleet. In the context of Movida, the company owns a fleet for . its rent-a-car business and outsourcing segments and sells used cars, therefore accounting for a high . carbon profile for its scope 3 emissions related to the use of goods and services sold. Furthermore, . the sector is highly exposed to other environmental and social risks, including air pollution and . transport safety risks."
5,0.9375,"ISS ESG finds that climate change mitigation and the GHG emissions reduction KPI selected by the . issuer is:"
5,0.875,"• . Relevant to Movida’s business as its industry is highly GHG-emitting, especially on the scope . 3 of its operations and exposed to climate change mitigation solutions (e.g. alternative . combustion engines and fuels, electric vehicles)."
5,0.8125,"• . Core to the issuer’s business as climate change mitigation reduction measures, especially on . the scope 3 of operations that represent a vast majority of the GHG emissions of Movida, will . impact key processes and operations (e.g. fleet management)."
5,0.75,"• . Material to Movida from an ESG perspective as it is one of the key ESG issues faced by the . Transport & Logistics industry and hence Movida can have material impact on the issue, . especially by including the scope 3 of operations within the scope of the selected KPI."
5,0.25,"Consistency with overall company’s sustainability strategy"
5,0.5,"Through its Corporate Sustainability Policy, Movida is committed to sustainability. Those . commitments focus on the various social topics (e.g. diversity, urban mobility as inclusion, traffic . safety), governance (e.g. business ethics and corporate governance, taking part to national and . international sustainability agendas) and environmental topics. Climate change mitigation, . adaptation and offsetting has been defined as one of the key sustainability priorities of Movida."
5,0.5625,"Specific objectives related to climate change mitigation have also been defined along the sustainable . view of Movida, on the axis “Better planet”. In this context, Movida is committed to become carbon . neutral by 2030 and to become carbon positive in 2040 (through climate mitigation measures to . reduce its GHG emissions, as captured in the context of this bond, and through carbon emissions . offsetting measures, which are not considered and accounted for in the scope of this transaction)."
