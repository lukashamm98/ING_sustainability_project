5,0.7313432835820897,"Discussing this further in 2020 with equity and debt investors, . as well as with our relationship banks and their sustainability . teams, we got very positive feedback on what we, as a company, . had already accomplished on ESG over the years. We got the . distinct impression that we were ahead of most shipping . companies; we have improved the energy efficiency of our . fleet by 30% since 2008, and Odfjell now controls the most . fuel-efficient chemical tanker fleet in the world..  . Just one year later, we can confidently state that our  . discussions have been a success, with Odfjell issuing the first . sustainability-linked bond in the world within the shipping . sector, and the first in the Nordics. The bond is linked to Odfjell’s . fleet transition plan and ambition to reduce the carbon intensity . of our controlled fleet by 50% by 2030, compared to 2008. More . than 1/3 of the book was thought to be significantly, if not . entirely, dependent upon the ESG link. We are currently looking . at using Odfjell’s Sustainability-Linked Finance Framework for . traditional vessel financing with our banks."
5,0.8805970149253731,"We believe Odfjell’s sustainability-. linked finance framework is a . testament to our ambitious targets, . and our commitment to reduce . carbon emissions as set out in  . our fleet transition plan."
5,0.6865671641791045,"Furthermore, we believe that setting ambitious and measurable . ESG targets reduces our risk and makes good business sense. .

This positive development . was quickly interrupted by the Covid-19 outbreak in China in . February, which went global moving into the second quarter . and initially reduced activity."
8,0.3125,"As market players were preparing for challenging times, an . oil-price war emerged which, along with lost demand due to . lockdowns, sent the oil price tumbling. Global inventory levels . quickly filled up, leading to a large portion of the tanker fleet . being employed as floating storage, which led to a severe . shortage of ships that sent crude, CPP and chemical tanker . rates soaring to all-time highs."
8,0.33333333333333337,"As the oil market stabilized, chemical producers regained . control of their inventory and the world, to some extent, . learned to live with the pandemic. Chemical tanker demand . quickly recovered and kept the chemical tanker market . relatively strong into the third quarter. This demand was . driven by geographical variations in the effect of the pandemic . and lockdowns, producers taking advantage of low prices to . build inventories, and resilient demand for essential products . being carried on board chemical tankers."
8,0.35416666666666663,"The chemical tanker market did not recover after the season- . ally slower summer months and as the second wave of . the pandemic and lockdowns took hold. As the demand"
8,0.6666666666666667,"recovery faltered, producers favored lower priced inventories and a . very challenging CPP market increased the share of swing tonnage . competitors."
8,0.25,"Preliminary figures point to chemical tanker demand being marginally . positive in 2020, compared to a net fleet growth of 2.5%, while effective . supply growth was negative in the first half of 2020 and for 2020 as a . whole, when the effect of swing tonnage is taken into account."
8,0.5833333333333334,"Safety. Safety is our number one priority, and we always keep safety at the heart . of everything we do. In 2020, our Lost Time Injury Frequency* was 0.21, . which was below our target and an improvement from 0.89 in 2019.  Our . ambition of realizing zero fatalities and zero injuries remains the same."
8,0.5416666666666666,"The biggest impact from the pandemic was the heavy burden placed . on our seafarers, as crew changes were impossible for a long time. .

9,0.29411764705882354,"The International Monetary Fund's latest prediction estimates . a global GDP growth of 5.5% in 2021, which corresponds well . with our forecast of a recovery from the second half of 2021and . into 2022. Furthermore, it is expected that policy stimuli will be . high across the globe in the aftermath of the pandemic, and . lead to strong economic activity and chemical consumption . across the globe."
9,0.17647058823529413,"The expansion of new, low-cost chemical production capacity . that has helped boost tonne-mile demand growth in the last . years, will slow down over the next couple of years. US and . Middle Eastern producers are therefore expected to contribute . to strong demand growth through gaining market share from . high-cost producers rather than growth in capacity."
9,0.2058823529411765,"The supply fundamentals for chemical tankers are encouraging, . with a record low orderbook and limited new orders taking . place. Traditionally, a low orderbook leads to increased orders, . but the uncertainty around future propulsion systems could . mean the next few years becoming an exception to the rule. . Ordering new vessels today is associated with high residual . risk for shipowners and for lenders too, which also limits . available financing to fund larger newbuilding orders. This . situation is not unique to chemical tankers and affects shipping . in general. This means that neighboring tanker segments are . experiencing declining orderbooks and lack of orders as well, . which is something we depend upon for reduced competition . from swing tonnage in the years to come."
9,0.14705882352941177,"We therefore believe that the fundamentals in our markets are . strong, and this should bolster the continued recovery of the . chemical tanker markets over the next few years."

Odfjell Terminals US (OTUS) experienced strong demand for storage . in the first two quarters of 2020, with some signs of softening during . the second half of the year as Covid-19 contributed to reduced down-. stream demand for certain product categories.

Their handling . of the situation was nothing short of impressive."
11,0.24489795918367346,"2020 also marked the completion of a multi-year restructuring . of the Odfjell Terminals organization and portfolio.

The current outlook for 2021 . is very uncertain and will, to a large extent, depend on developments . in the USA, with further repercussions expected from Covid-19 and . possible European trade barriers."
12,0.4838709677419355,"In Korea, demand for refined petroleum storage facilities is sluggish, . and will be slow to recover, as the transportation sector struggles . to bounce back. A slowdown in the operation rate of oil refineries is . exacerbating the situation. Demand for petrochemicals is expected to . remain strong due to a robust demand for olefin products.

We now operate the world’s . largest and most efficient and competitive deep-sea stainless-steel fleet. . In 2020, spot rates improved compared to 2019, and the momentum in . renewals of our Contracts of Affreightments (CoAs), which began in . 2019, continued. Future tonne-mile demand outlook appears robust, . and slower supply growth should ensure a continued recovery of our . markets. The main risk scenario is a prolonged economic slowdown . and potentially, the influx of more swing tonnage. As a company we . are prepared for different scenarios with our contingency plans."
24,0.4482758620689655,"Chemical tanker spot freight rates improved materially in the first half of . 2020, but weakened as the year progressed, and ended the year softer . than at the beginning of the year. Chemical tanker front haul routes . have performed well throughout most of the year, while the back-haul . routes and routes often closely linked to the CPP rate, which has been . volatile, have suffered. The number of trading days, including external . pool vessels, increased to 29,453 from 28,666 days, while trading . days, excluding external pool vessels, was stable at 20,877 days. . Total volumes carried in 2020 were 15.2 million tonnes, compared to . 14.4 million tonnes in 2019. This relates mainly to the growth of our . external pool vessels, combined with a cargo mix throughout the year . that included larger parcels."
24,0.5862068965517241,"Nominations under our CoAs were lower than 2019 levels. The contract . coverage for the year decreased to 46% of total volume shipped, against . 54% in 2019. The main reason for the decrease in CoA coverage was . a larger drop in the second quarter, as a consequence of Covid-19, but . it has since recovered and is back at more normal levels. Our decision . not to renew CoAs at unprofitable levels has continued in 2020, and . these volumes have been replaced by new CoAs and spot volumes . for a shorter period."
24,0.41379310344827586,"2020 was a challenging year that proved the resilience of our global . platform and business model. Despite the pandemic, Odfjell delivered . stronger results and performed well on important operational and safety . measures. The biggest fallout from the pandemic was the heavy burden . placed on our seafarers, as crew changes became impossible for an . extended period. Even today, crew changes remain a challenge. We . had to contend with often unreasonable port states across the globe, . a severe lack of flights, community lockdowns by governments, greatly . increased response times from relevant authorities, and extensive . quarantine arrangements. This led to many seafarers being unable . to sign off or sign on, and in some cases, being on board vessels for . more than a year. Despite these challenges, our operational and safety . performance remained at an all-time high."
24,0.27586206896551724,"The pandemic led to a lot of volatility in our markets, in terms of volume . and rates, which affected our commercial planning as we dealt with . numerous unforeseen events. But the unpredictability and rapid changes . in market dynamics over the last year have proved to be the ultimate . test for our global platform and demonstrated just how resilient and . flexible it is. In the initial phase of the pandemic, as customers tried to . manage their inventory levels, we were able to quickly pivot from low . CoA nominations to negotiating attractive spot volumes in a very strong . CPP, vegetable oil and commodity chemical market. Once chemical . producers began to return to normal, we maneuvered back with higher . contract volumes and we reduced our exposure to materially weaker . CPP and vegetable oil markets. This would not have been possible . without the robust operational platform of our global, experienced, . and dedicated team operating a flexible fleet."
24,0.48275862068965514,"We concluded our largest fleet renewal program by taking delivery of . the last supersegregator newbuilding in October 2020. The fleet renewal . program has been concluded through newbuildings, acquisitions, . long-term charters, pool establishments and many replacements . within our short-term time charter portfolio. We have established two . new coated pools consisting of coated MR and handysize tonnage. . With this, we have taken steps to rebuild our presence in the coated . chemical tanker market in a capital efficient way, while contributing to . the consolidation of our market. All our fleet initiatives have ensured . that we now operate a balanced, flexible fleet that is ready to meet . changes in market dynamics. We now have limited capital expenditure, . for the coming years, and are well placed to benefit from an expected . upturn in the market. Our determination not to renew unsustainably . low CoA rates continued in 2020, and those that we did renew were . on average 5% higher."
24,0.3448275862068966,"The transition to new, sulfur-compliant fuel was seamless. The concern . of escalating bunker costs having a competitive disadvantage in relation . to competitors with scrubbers already installed, did not materialize. . Our focus is now set on 2030 and 2050, when new regulations for the . shipping industry to reduce its carbon footprint will come into force. . Through our fleet renewal and structured long-term work on reducing . our emissions, we are well positioned and have a detailed road map to . meet regulations for 2030. Part of this map has been included in our . sustainability framework. We have set a target of operating a climate . neutral fleet by 2050 and will only order vessels with zero-emission . technology from 2030.

The trend was interrupted by Covid-19 emerging in China, a major . importer of liquid chemicals, before the market improved significantly . when the oil price war began in April and floating storage led to a . material reduction in supply, which exceeded the initial reduction in . demand for chemicals. Chemical tanker demand recovered quickly . in the aftermath of government lockdowns, and remained positive . until destocking, and a new round of lockdowns, hurt demand and . weakened the market towards the end of the year. Second half of the . year, this was paired with increased competition from swing tonnage . due to a weakened CPP and crude oil tanker market."

We have . seen the pandemic and its impact on GDP differ materially across the . globe, with the eastern hemisphere coping better than the western . hemisphere. Advanced economies are estimated to see a GDP drop . of -4.9% in 2020, and GDP growth in emerging markets is estimated . to be -2.4%. The variations in economic activity during the pandemic . impacted chemical tanker trade positively, as exports of surplus product . across regions stimulated trading activity as seen in the increased . tonne-miles. The drop in feedstock prices, and commodity prices in . general, contributed positively to trade as importers saw lower prices . as an opportunity to build inventories."

Odfjell has a diversified debt structure and has access to a wide range . of funding sources and structures from top-tier banks, export credit . agencies, leasing houses and from the bond markets. Although funding . is available to Odfjell from a wide range of funding sources, shipping . debt markets have changed. Several Western banks and credit investors . have pulled out of, or reduced their exposure to shipping."
34,0.5660377358490566,"Leasing structures, primarily from China, and the private equity and . project finance markets have gained significant market share."
34,0.9811320754716981,"Sustainable finance and ESG have . become increasingly important when . it comes to access to financing and . access to capital. This is a welcome . trend that we encourage and expect . to gain from, given our strong track . record and active role in various  . ESG initiatives."
34,0.5471698113207547,"We have adapted to remain competitive and this is reflected in our . current capital structure. Bank loans still cover the core part of our . fleet, but financial leases, time charter and bareboat agreements have . financed much of our recent tonnage renewal and growth initiatives."
34,0.8679245283018868,"We are also a frequent issuer of bonds and a household name in the . Norwegian high yield market, and on January 21, 2021, we issued the . first sustainability-linked bond in shipping and in the Nordics across . industries."
34,0.6415094339622641,"As of December 31, 2020, Odfjell’s total nominal debt was USD 1,526 . million, of which 24% was mortgaged loans, 43% was financial leases, . 15% was senior unsecured bonds, and 18% was debt related to long-. term time charter and bareboat agreements (IFRS 16 leases). The . average maturity of the Group’s total interest-bearing debt, after the . bond refinancing in January 2021, is 5.9 years. In an effort to lower . interest rate expenses and overall cost of capital, surplus liquidity is . placed in bank deposits and money market funds, or as repayment . on our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, the size of . the Group’s revolving credit facility is USD 160 million, of which USD . 42 million is undrawn."
34,0.6981132075471699,"Cash break-even. Odfjell is exposed to the natural cyclicality of the shipping industry . and it is important that we have a sustainable cash flow generation . across cycles to secure flexibility on capital allocation. A strategic . focus is therefore to reduce our cash break-even levels by deleveraging, . and extend amortization profiles to better match our vessels’ trading . strategy and economic life. Our target is to reach a cash break-even . level of USD 18,000 to USD 19,500 per day, which will ensure that we . can generate positive cash flows throughout cycles, which again will . reduce the overall market risk for Odfjell."
34,0.8490566037735848,"Tax . The Odfjell Group operates within a number of jurisdictions and tax . regimes, including the Norwegian tonnage tax system and the Approved . International Shipping system in Singapore. In addition, we operate . under the local tax systems in Brazil. Our tank terminal activities are . generally subject to the ordinary corporate tax rates within the country . in which the activity is located."

This is achieved through ensuring funding from diversified . structures and sources, maintaining adequate liquidity or . credit reserves at all times, and through the systematic . monitoring and management of risks related to currencies, . interest rates, and bunkers."
34,0.7547169811320755,"Financial derivatives are used to reduce unwanted fluctuations . in the Company’s net result and cash flows caused by . movements in currencies, interest rates and bunker prices . to which Odfjell is exposed to. Similarly, financial derivatives . may be used to lock-in a target return on an investment, . financing, project or contract. This may also limit Odfjell’s . upside potential from favorable movements in the same . financial risks."
34,0.8113207547169812,"Earnings. Earnings within the chemical tanker markets are less volatile . than in many other shipping segments, as the universe of . cargo products we transport is diversified, and our customers . are industrial companies with stable logistics needs, unlike . comparable tanker segments, where traders play a larger . part in the overall demand drivers."
34,0.7924528301886792,"The portfolio of trade lanes, and the products we transport, . have historically provided a partial hedge against the negative . impact of a general slowdown in demand for chemical tanker . freight."
34,0.5849056603773585,"Our time charter earnings are influenced by external factors . such as global economic growth, the general ship-freight . market, bunkers prices and factors such as cargo type and . cargo volume, trading pattern required by our customers, . contract and spot rates, and operational efficiency. Time is . of the essence, and optimal utilization of the fleet and an . expedient composition of cargoes with minimal time in port, . are vital to maximize our time charter earnings."
34,0.5283018867924528,"The largest single cost component affecting time charter . earnings is bunkers, and Odfjell makes physical purchases of . bunkers worldwide. In 2020, this amounted to USD 169 million,"
34,0.7169811320754716,"equivalent to 49% of voyage costs. A substantial part of the . Group’s exposure is hedged through bunkers adjustment . clauses in contracts of affreightments. Bunkers consumption . from contracts without bunkers adjustment clauses and . spot volumes are considered for financial hedging. As of . December 31, 2020, Odfjell has hedged approximately 22% . of bunkers consumption in FY2021 that is not related to . bunkers adjustment clauses."
34,0.6226415094339622,"Sensitivity analyses show that a change in time charter . earnings of 5% for our chemical tankers in freight rates . after voyage costs, will impact the pre-tax net result by . approximately USD 25 million. Odfjell is not engaged in the . derivative market for forwarding freight agreements. Our . tank terminal activities have historically shown more stable . earnings than our shipping activities."
34,0.7735849056603773,"A substantial part of the tank terminal costs is fixed, and . the main drivers for earnings within a tank terminal are the . general market conditions, occupancy rate, the volume of . cargoes handled through and by the terminal, and operational . efficiency."
34,0.7358490566037736,"Interest rates. All interest-bearing debt, except bonds in the Norwegian . bond market and debt borne by tank terminals outside the . USA, is denominated in USD. The majority of these loans . are floating rate with USD LIBOR as a benchmark. We use . financial interest rate derivatives, mainly interest rate swaps, . to reduce the variability of interest expenses on loans that . arise because of changes in the USD LIBOR. As of December . 31, 2020, interest rate payments corresponding to USD 375 . million of loans have been swapped from floating to fixed . rates, and Odfjell’s nominal interest-bearing debt was USD . 1,256 million, of which approximately 37% is fixed."
34,0.8301886792452831,"Currency. The Group’s revenues are primarily denominated in USD. . Currency risk relates mainly to the net result and cash flow . from voyage related expenses, ship operating expenses, . general and administrative expenses and financial expenses"

37,0.09523809523809523,"2.1 Basis for preparation"
37,0.32142857142857145,"The Odfjell Group has prepared its consolidated . financial statements according to International . Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) approved by . the EU. The consolidated financial statements have . been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for . derivatives which are measured at fair value."
37,0.39285714285714285,"The principal accounting policies applied in . the preparation of these consolidated financial . statements are set out below. These policies have . been consistently applied to all the years presented, . unless otherwise stated."

37,0.35714285714285715,"The accounting policies adopted are consistent with . those of the previous financial year."
37,0.4880952380952381,"The following new standards and amendments . became effective as at January 1, 2020:. • Amendments to IFRS 3 Definition of a Business. • Amendments to IFRS 7, IFRS 9 and IAS 39 Interest . rate benchmark reform. • Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of . Material. • Amendments to IFRS 16 Covid-19 related rent . concessions"
37,0.20238095238095238,"The amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39 Financial . Instruments: Recognition and Measurement provide . a number of reliefs, which apply to all hedging . relationships that are directly affected by interest . rate benchmark reform. The reliefs relate to hedge . accounting and have the effect that the reforms should . not generally cause the hedge accounting to terminate."
37,0.17857142857142858,"The amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 provide a new . definition of material that states, “information is"

A misstatement of . information is material if it could reasonably be . expected to influence decisions made by the . primary users.This amendment had no impact on . the consolidated financial statements of the Group."
37,0.21428571428571427,"On May 28, 2020, the IASB issued Covid-19-Related . Rent Concessions - amendment to IFRS 16 Leases. . The amendments provide relief to lessees from . applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease modification . accounting for rent concessions arising as a direct . consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a practical . expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether . a Covid-19 related rent concession from a lessor is . a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election . accounts for any change in lease payments resulting . from the Covid-19 related rent concession the same . way it would account for the change under IFRS 16, . if the change were not a lease modification. The . amendment applies to annual reporting periods . beginning on or after June 1, 2020. Earlier application . is permitted. This amendment had no impact on the . consolidated financial statements of the Group."
37,0.19047619047619047,"2.3 Revenues from contract with customers"
37,0.15476190476190477,"Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized . when control of the services is transferred to the . customer at an amount that reflects the consideration . to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange . for those goods or services. The Group has generally . concluded that it is the principal in its revenue . arrangements, because it typically controls the . services before transferring them to the customer."
37,0.2380952380952381,"Freight revenue from transportation of liquids by sea. The Group recognizes revenue from rendering of . transportation services over time, because the . customer simultaneously receives and consumes the . benefits provided by the Group. The Group recognizes . freight revenue over time from load port to discharge . port by measuring the progress towards complete . satisfaction of the services.  Number of days sailed . from load port compared to total estimated days until . discharge port is used as a measure of progress. . The method applied is the one that most faithfully . depicts our progress towards complete satisfaction . of the performance obligation."
37,0.28571428571428575,"Variable consideration. If the consideration in a contract includes a variable . amount, the Group estimates the amount of . consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange . for transferring the service to the customer. The . variable consideration is estimated at contract . inception or when changes in circumstances occur . and is recognized as revenue if it is highly probable . that there will not be a significant reversal of revenue . in a future period. The Group is estimating demurrage . revenue as a variable consideration when delays . occur and the vessel is prevented from loading or . discharging cargo within the stipulated laytime. The . variable consideration based on contracted price . terms and estimated excess time taken to discharge . or load are being recognized as part of the freight . service revenue over time for the remaining voyage . (from the delay occur to the discharge port)."
37,0.34523809523809523,"Contract balances. Contract assets: A contract asset is the right to . consideration in exchange for goods or services . transferred to the customer. Contract assets are . recognized revenue for freight services partly . satisfied from voyages that have commenced but . are not completed and invoices have not been issued . as per December 31. Contract assets are reclassified . to receivables from contracts with customers once . the freight service is being invoiced to the customer, . at the latest when the voyage is completed. Contract . assets include variable consideration only when it is . highly probable there will be no significant reversal . at a later date when the uncertainty related to the . variable payment is resolved."
37,0.4523809523809524,"Trade receivables: A receivable represents the . Group’s right to an amount of consideration that . is unconditional."
37,0.2976190476190476,"Contract liabilities: A contract liability is the obligation . to transfer goods or services to a customer for . which the Group has received consideration (or an . amount of consideration is due) from the customer. . If a customer pays consideration before the Group . transfers goods or services to the customer, a . contract liability is recognized when the payment is . made. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue . when the Group fulfills the performance obligation(s) .  under the contract."
37,0.36904761904761907,"Cost to obtain a contract. The Group has elected to apply the optional practical . expedient for costs to obtain a contract, e.g. broker . commissions, which allows the Group to immediately . expense such costs when the related revenue is . expected to be recognized within one year."
37,0.38095238095238093,"External pool vessels. Odfjell operates pools of ships delivering freight . services to customers and external ships participate . in the pools. Under IFRS 15, Odfjell acts as a principal . for the external ships in the pool since the freight . service delivered to the customer is controlled by . Odfjell. Revenues generated by external ships in the . pool are therefore recognized as gross revenue in . the income statement."

37,0.25,"Operating segments are reported in the manner . consistent with the internal financial reporting . provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The . chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible . for allocating resources and assessing performance . of the operating segment, has been identified as the . Board and Executive Management which makes the . strategic decisions. In the internal reporting, the . proportionate consolidation method is used for the . Group’s share of investments in joint ventures and . associates.

For derivatives . classified as level 2, fair value is calculated by using observable forward curves. For interest rate swaps, fair value is determined by the expected cash flows for the . floating rate leg using the forward interest rate curve at the balance sheet date, less fixed rate payments. Currencies and commodities are determined based on the . current forward rate compared to contractual rates for the same time period. For some non-derivative financial assets and liabilities we consider carrying amount . to be the best estimate of fair value due to short maturity date and valid terms, i.e. interest bearing debt except bond loans, current receivables and payables."

For cash and cash equivalents and current liabilities the carrying amount is considered to be a reasonable estimate . of fair value of these instruments due to the short maturity date. Receivables are measured at nominal value reduced by any impairment. Carrying amount is . considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value due to short maturity date and valid terms.
