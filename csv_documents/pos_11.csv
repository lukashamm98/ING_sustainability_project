A responsible approach to employees, . suppliers, customers, and neighbors is a matter of course for us, . whether in direct business operations or in the surrounding areas. . The same applies to the environment, as we are aware of the . limits of natural resources and want to keep negative impacts . from our business activities to a minimum."

In the process, no non-financial risks . were identified that were very likely to cause a serious negative . impact on employee and environmental matters, on respect for . human rights, on the prevention of corruption and bribery, or on . social matters. Nevertheless, it is important to us to handle non-. financial risks even if they are evaluated as non-material according . to the strict definition of the HGB. We have developed and . implemented management approaches accordingly."

These are . translated into concrete targets and measures for which we have . established implementation deadlines and key performance . indicators (KPIs) so that our sustainable company development . can be measured and guided. During the reporting year, we . subjected our Sustainability Strategy to an interim review. The . updated strategy should be passed and published by the . Executive Board in the new fiscal year.

With our . multimetal recycling, we actively take part in the modern circular . economy, promote the efficient and environmentally friendly use . of valuable resources, and contribute to raw material security."
15,0.4,"Aurubis plays a vital role in the recycling chain: thanks to our . integrated smelter network, we are able to process a broad range . of materials, from industrial waste that accumulates directly from . our production or our customers, to complex materials  Glossary,"
15,0.3,"page 207 from end-of-life products. From these materials, we . produce metals that can be directly used in new products."
15,0.5,"In addition to the processing of copper concentrates, the . recycling of copper scrap and complex recycling raw materials . such as circuit boards is a key business area at Aurubis. Non-. ferrous metals like copper can be recycled as often as desired . without a loss of quality. This means that copper of the highest . purity can be produced from recycling materials again and again. . Furthermore, complex recycling raw materials contain not only . copper but a number of other accompanying elements that can . be recovered, such as gold, silver, nickel, tin, lead, and zinc."
15,0.6,"To us, complex recycling raw materials include industrial residues, . slimes, and shredder materials, as well as end-of-life materials that . for instance originate from electronic devices, vehicles, and other . everyday items. These consist of increasingly diversified material . combinations that include plastics, ceramic, or glass. Separating . them into material and product streams by type in order to  . reuse them is a significant challenge. Furthermore, because of . miniaturization, smaller and smaller amounts of metal are . contained in end-of-life electronic devices, for instance. We utilize . highly developed mechanical and metallurgical separating and . refining processes in different combinations as part of our . multimetal expertise. With our subsidiary Metallo, acquired in . 2020, non-ferrous metals such as tin and zinc will be recovered . even more efficiently in the expanded smelter network."
15,0.8,"The Commercial division is responsible for sourcing recycling . materials for the Group. This is divided into the departments . Recycling Raw Materials (which handles the material supply for . the smelters), Marketing Cathodes (which supplies the production . facilities with cathodes and “direct melt” raw materials), and . Product Sales & Marketing with the function Customer Scrap . Solutions (which supplies the smelters and production facilities . with production waste from our copper product customers).  . This organization aligns with our recycling approach: we use . secondary materials from production and from end-of-life . products as raw materials and view this as a closed loop."
15,0.7,"In the marketing of our products and in our customer . relationships, we therefore include the return of the metals in  . our thinking. We provide individualized solutions for taking back . recycling materials that accumulate in the processing of our . copper products, as well as other metals in the different value-. added stages that take place with our product customers and . their customers. Depending on the value-added stage, they . accumulate materials with very high copper contents, such as . Millberry scrap, which can be immediately directed to the copper . production process, or more complex or alloyed production waste . that can also be smelted, such as copper-, tin-, lead-, and precious . metal-bearing stamping waste, slags from foundries, and other . industrial residues like used catalysts and galvanic slimes. This . demonstrates that thanks to our integrated smelter network, we . find solutions, even for significant metallurgical challenges, and . are thus able to serve customers from a variety of sectors – from . smaller scrap traders to global industrial companies and . customers of the recycling industry, all of which make up our . broad base of recycling raw material suppliers."
15,1.0,"As part of our “closing-the-loop” activities  Glossary, page 207, we . build up partnerships through which we not only sell our products . but also take back recycling raw materials customers accumulate, . in addition to other service offerings.

16,0.625,"Aurubis processes recycling materials at different sites. The . managers of these sites report to the chief operations officer. Our . sites in Lünen (Germany) and Olen (Belgium), as well as the newly . acquired Metallo sites in Beerse (Belgium) and Berango (Spain), . specialize in processing recycling raw materials. Recycling raw . materials are nearly the only feedstock at our largest recycling . plant, the Aurubis recycling center in Lünen. The Lünen plant is . certified through WEEELABEX in accordance with the European . series of standards EN 50625. The certificate confirms that waste . electrical and electronic devices are efficiently treated and . disposed of in a way that minimizes environmental impacts and . emissions of harmful substances. Aurubis participated in the . development of the standards that preceded the series of . standards. The Metallo plants process about 315,000 t of complex . secondary raw materials each year to recover not only copper, tin . and lead, but also metal intermediates such as nickel sulfate . solution and zinc oxide. Metallo follows a “zero waste” strategy . with the goal of transforming as many scrap materials as possible . into valuable products. The company fosters this strategy with its . “Furnace of Innovation” approach, recycling increasingly complex . raw materials and investing in technological innovations for the . refining process. Metallo therefore has a forerunner role in metal . recycling and optimally complements Aurubis’ similar approach."
16,0.875,"Moreover, we have two companies with unique expertise within . the Group: our subsidiary E.R.N. specializes in recycling electrical . and electronic devices of all kinds, while CABLO specializes in . recycling our copper customers’ cable production waste and cable . scrap. In November 2020, Aurubis and the recycling company TSR . Recycling signed an agreement to establish a recycling joint . venture. The company’s objective is to bundle the cable . dismantling activities of Aurubis subsidiary CABLO and TSR. . Aurubis will hold 40 % of the joint venture, which will go by the . name of Cablo GmbH in the future. The review by the responsible . merger control authorities is expected to conclude in fiscal year . 2020/21."
16,0.5,"The Hamburg and Pirdop sites also process recycling raw . materials. Though the primary smelters utilize copper . concentrates as their main feed material, they also use copper . scrap to a certain extent because it is ideal for process cooling . and therefore enables particularly energy-efficient processing."
