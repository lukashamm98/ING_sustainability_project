1,0.08333333333333334,""
1,0.41666666666666663,"Ladies and Gentlemen,"
1,0.25,"On behalf of the Management Board of TAURON Polska Energia S.A. I have the pleasure to present to . you the Consolidated Annual Report of TAURON Polska Energia S.A. Capital Group for 2020, that . provides our financial and operating results, as well as the most important accomplishments of last year."
1,1.0,"2020 will go down in history as the year of the coronavirus pandemic. It affected all areas of the economic . life."
1,0.75,"In spite of the challenging conditions in the market environment and the decline in the volumes of . electricity distribution and supply, the financial position of TAURON Group has remained stable. We . adapted to the new situation efficiently, while the procedures introduced with respect to the functioning . of the Group’s subsidiaries in a pandemic environment allowed us to ensure continuity of the production . and supply of electricity to our customers."
1,0.16666666666666669,"Taking into account such extraordinary circumstances my view of the financial results generated by . TAURON Group in 2020 is positive. Sales revenue came in at PLN 20.9 billion, which meant a 7 percent. . increase as compared to the previous year. EBITDA clocked in at PLN 4.2 billion and it was higher by . 17 percent  than in 2019. The consolidated loss attributable to the shareholders of the parent company . stood at PLN 2.5 billion, mainly as a result of the booking of the impairment charges related to the loss . of the assets’ carrying amount, first and foremost in the Generation and Mining segments. The net debt . to EBITDA ratio continued to stay at a level that guaranteed financial stability and security."
1,0.5833333333333334,"In reference to the market trends that we observed last year, it should be emphasized that it was a . period of an extremely fast growth of prosumer energy in the field of renewable energy sources (RES). . As a result, the installed capacity in photovoltaic technology in Poland increased by almost 150 percent . as compared to 2019, i.e. from 1.5 GW to 4 GW. In this context, it should be noted that TAURON Group . connected 100 000 RES micro-installations with the total capacity of 658 MW to its distribution grid in . 2020. This is over three times more than in 2019. Overall, the total capacity of RES installations . connected to TAURON Group's grid reached 823 MW in 2020."
1,0.33333333333333337,"The expansion of renewable energy sources is an investment priority for TAURON Group, and this is . why we are taking a number of initiatives to ensure that the Green Turn of TAURON, announced in May . 2019, follows the strategic directions set. As part of the strategy, we are assuming that the share of zero . emission sources in the Group's generation mix will rise to 66 percent by 2030. The planned investments . in renewable energy sources and the decommissioning of the obsolete conventional generation sources . will allow the Group to reduce its emissions by more than 50 percent by 2030."
1,0.5,"TAURON Group is currently operating nine onshore wind farms with the total capacity of 381 MW. We . want to increase this potential to more than 1 000 MW of installed capacity by 2025. The first significant . step, as part of the implementation of the strategy, was the acquisition of five wind farms with the . capacity of 180 MW in 2019. In December 2020, in turn, we acquired a 30 MW wind farm project located . in the Łódź Province. The wind farm should be commissioned in mid-2022."
1,0.9166666666666667,"Speaking of wind energy, it should be added that offshore wind farms will play an important role in our . plans to expand zero emission capacity. Due to its windiness and depth, the Baltic Sea is considered to . be one of the most promising reservoirs for the development of this type of energy generation in Europe. . We signed a letter of intent on the cooperation in this area with PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna and . Enea in January 2021."
1,0.8333333333333333,"Another important element of TAURON Group's expansion strategy is related to photovoltaics. In . accordance with the assumptions of the Green Turn of TAURON, we are planning to operate . photovoltaic farms with the capacity of 300 MW as part of our portfolio by 2025. In December 2020, we . completed the implementation of the first farm based on such technology in Jaworzno, on the Group’s . post-industrial land. The electricity generated by that installation will power more than two thousand . households. The construction of the Choszczno project is underway - a complex of photovoltaic farms . with the total capacity of 6 MW that will be extended by another 8 MW. We signed several preliminary . contracts last year, including agreements for the acquisition of six photovoltaic projects and five wind . projects."
2,0.8461538461538461,"I would like to emphasize with satisfaction that the volume of electricity produced by TAURON Group . from renewable sources went by more than 40 percent in 2020, as compared to the previous year."
2,0.4615384615384615,"Last year, we completed the construction of our final projects in the field of conventional energy - a 910 . MW coal fired power generating unit in Jaworzno and a 450 MW CCGT power generating unit in Stalowa . Wola. They are efficient, modern generation units, adapted to meet the demanding environment . protection standards, that will constitute an important element of Poland's energy security."
2,0.3846153846153846,"Referring to the investment activities, it is worth emphasizing that last year TAURON Group allocated a . budget in the amount of PLN 4 billion for investment projects, with the largest funds going to the . Distribution and Generation segments. In the former one, the capital expenditures of PLN 1.9 billion . were spent mainly on the modernization of the distribution grid and the installation of the new grid . connections, in the latter one – on the completion of the power generating unit in Jaworzno."
2,0.6153846153846154,"Similar as in the previous years, also in 2020 we undertook a number of effective initiatives aimed at . guaranteeing the funds required for TAURON Group’s sustainable development. First of all, I would like . to mention the first issue of sustainable development bonds in Poland, as part of which we issued five-. year bonds worth PLN 1 billion, with the proceeds to be spent on the Group’s energy transition. We also . signed two loan agreements for the total amount of PLN 1 billion last year."
2,0.11538461538461538,""
2,0.7692307692307692,"Ladies and Gentlemen,"
2,0.6923076923076923,"In spite of the numerous challenges facing the Polish energy sector, I am convinced that the steadfast . implementation of the assumptions of the Green Turn of TAURON will have a positive impact on . TAURON Group’s market position and prospects. I believe that high competence and extensive . experience of the Group's employees will be skillfully used to shore up the key segments of our business . operations. On the other hand, our initiatives with respect to social dialogue will continue to contribute . to building long term, partnership based relations with all stakeholder groups."
2,1.0,"On behalf of the Management Board of TAURON Polska Energia S.A. I would like to thank all . stakeholders for their commitment and dedication to building TAURON Group’s value."

The price will be subject to a light upward . pressure resulting from the sustainable upward trends observed in the domestic mining cost. However, in the long . term (2025-2040), coal prices will continue to fall due to the accelerated implementation of the decarbonisation policy . promoted by the European Union, aimed at reaching the climate neutrality in Europe by 2050. Its manifestation is the . definite abandonment of coal by individual countries (including Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland). Another of . its aspects is the increase in the share of energy from RES sources in the energy balance of European Union . Member States. After 2025, the price of coal in Poland will begin to fall, as a result of a decline in electricity generation . with the use of this raw material as well as an expected increase in import volumes in view of high levels of mining . cost in the country.

Between 2024 and 2040, the wholesale . electricity price (in constant prices) will increase by 16.8%. The forecast of wholesale electricity prices is affected by . the current and expected situation in the national power system, fuel price forecasts and the costs of purchase of CO2 . emission allowances. In 2021, a slight increase in energy prices by 1.5% compared to 2020 was assumed due to, . among others, the anticipated further impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fuel prices and declining levels of margins . earned on the sales of electricity from coal-fired sources. The increase in prices by 2029 results from the growth in . prices of CO2 emission allowances and planned shutdowns of coal-fired and nuclear units in Germany directly . affecting the level of the interconnection exchange balance.

The calculations were based . on detailed projections up to 2030 and the estimated residual value, while for the mining units the forecasts cover the . entire period of their operation. Reliance on projections covering a period longer than 5 years results mainly from the fact . that investment processes in the power industry are time-consuming.

The growth rate used for extrapolation of projected cash flows going beyond the detailed . planning period has been adopted at a level of 2.5% and corresponds to the estimated long-term inflation rate.

47,0.7058823529411765,"The Group has introduced a five-step model of revenue recognition comprising, successively: identifying the agreement with a . customer; identifying the performance obligations contained in the agreement; determining the transaction price; allocating the . transaction price to each performance obligation; and recognising the revenue upon satisfying a performance obligation arising from . the agreement."
47,0.676470588235294,"Revenue is recognised when (or as) the performance obligation is fulfilled in the form of transferring the promised goods, products, . materials (i.e. assets) or providing a service to a customer. The asset transfer takes place when a customer acquires control over . such an asset whereas in the case of  sales of electricity, gaseous fuel and heat, the energy is deemed sold when delivered to a . consumer."
47,0.9117647058823529,"Revenue is recognised in the amount expected by the Group, following reduction by VAT, excise duty and other sales taxes, charges . and discounts."
47,0.5,"The revenue comprises only the inflows of economic benefits received or receivable to the entity's own account. Amounts obtained . on behalf of third parties, with the Group acting as an agent, such as taxes on sales or VAT do not constitute economic benefits of . the Company and do not result in equity increases. Therefore, these amounts are not recognised in revenue. Similarly, the . transitional fee, cogeneration fee and RES fee charged by the Group from the end user of electricity and then transferred to the . Transmission System Operator is recognised in the net remuneration amount."
47,0.29411764705882354,"For goods and materials, revenue is recognised when the Group ceases to be permanently involved in the management of the goods . sold to the extent the function is usually performed in relation to owned goods, and when it ceases to effectively control these items."
47,0.8529411764705883,"Revenue of the financial year includes also accrued revenue which has not been measured and invoiced due to the settlement . system used by customers."

47,0.4411764705882353,"The Group companies operating in the Sales segment generate revenue from sales of electricity, gaseous fuel and distribution . services to retail and wholesale customers. This segment also generates revenues from road lighting maintenance services."
47,0.5294117647058824,"As at each balance sheet date, subject to observance of the prudence principle, an estimate is made of the amount of revenue from . the sale of electricity, gaseous fuel and distribution services relating to the financial year which, due to the settlement cycle . established in agreements with customers and the fact that invoicing is performed for a significant number of customers in periods . other than the reporting periods, will be invoiced in the subsequent year."

The transactions concluded as part of the implementation of the strategy change had an . impact on charging the value of the Group goods and materials sold in the amount of PLN 123 792 thousand. . As part of its management of the portfolio of CO2 emission allowances of its subsidiaries, the Company . purchases allowances for redemption purposes of the Group's generation companies. The main purpose of . concluding the above-mentioned  transactions by the Company is to secure the expected volume and cost of . purchase of CO2 emission allowances, which the Group's generating companies are obliged to redeem. In the . first quarter of 2020, the Group decided to change its strategy in the scope of hedging the redemption needs of . the Generation area, consisting of a one-off swap of exchange contracts with a delivery date in December 2020 . to OTC contracts with a delivery date in March 2021. The decision to change the strategy was made taking into . account current market circumstances which were difficult to predict at the time of concluding the transaction. . These circumstances included, in particular, the increasing cost of maintaining a position on the stock . exchange, which was related, among other things, to the need for ongoing contributions to stock exchange . deposits, the change in legal and market circumstances in the area of CO2 emissions trading related to Brexit . and the COVID-19 pandemic. In implementing the above change of the strategy, the Company sold off the . forward position with a delivery date in December 2020 held on the exchange (it entered into an opposite . transaction on the exchange), while purchasing the same volume in contracts with a delivery date in March . 2021 from counterparties on the OTC market. As a result of conclusion of the countertrade, the original contract . will not be settled by physical delivery and therefore the Company recognised this contract and the countertrade . in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments at a fair value (these contracts were settled in December . 2020). All new transactions concluded on the OTC market will be used for the purpose of meeting the . redemption obligation of the TAURON Group generating companies and therefore as excluded from the scope . of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments are not measured at a fair value. At the same time, the purchase of volume . performed with a delivery date in March 2021 from counterparties in the OTC market, at prices lower than the . purchase originally contracted, reduces the cost of the creation of the provision for CO2 liabilities for the current . and subsequent reporting periods by the Group. As a result of the foregoing, the Group estimates that the . cumulative impact of the change in strategy on the operating profit will not be significant. In the Group's opinion, . the change in the strategy makes it possible, in the current market situation, to secure the redemption needs of . the Group's generating companies in a manner mitigating the risks to which the Group is exposed."

92,0.85,"As at 31 December 2019, a provision for onerous contracts in the amount of PLN 237 445 thousand was created by the . companies in the Sales segment. This provision relates primarily to households, including customers benefiting from tariff . prices approved by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office (G tariff) in the amount of PLN 130 287 thousand and . individual customers who benefited from product price lists offered by the Company (GD price lists) in the amount of . PLN 99 570 thousand."
92,0.5,"The need to create the aforementioned provision for the G tariff resulted from the adoption, for the calculation of the . sales price for these customers for 2020, of the parameters set out in the call of the ERO President whose approval in . December 2019 results in the impossibility of obtaining revenues from the sale of electricity in a value that would cover . the justified costs of conducting activities in this field. The price level approved by the ERO President's decision for the G . tariff group for 2020 was also a significant reason for the losses arising on the GD price lists, for which the provision was . created. Some of the product contracts in the household segment link electricity rates to the G tariff price, therefore it . also prevents gaining sales revenue at a level ensuring covering of full variable costs of the business."
92,0.7,"At the same time, on 7 January 2020, the subsidiary, TAURON Sprzedaż Sp. z o.o. submitted an application for the . approval of the change of the electricity tariff for the consumers of tariff G groups for 2020, which is to transfer all justified . costs that were not accepted in the application approved in December 2019.  By virtue of its Decision of July 8, 2020, the . ERO President refused to approve changes in the electricity tariff for these customers. On 31 July 2020, the . Management Board of TAURON Sprzedaż Sp. z o.o. lodged an appeal to the Court of Competition and Consumer . Protection against the decision of the President of the Energy Regulatory Office of 8 July 2020."
92,0.65,"During 2020, as a result of the application of the above-mentioned price lists and tariffs, the companies generated a loss . on electricity sales to its customers and therefore used the above-described provisions for onerous contracts related to . 2020 in the amount of PLN 190 414 thousand, including the entire provision for the G tariff in the amount of PLN 130 287 . thousand and partial provision for GD tariffs in the amount of PLN 54 957 thousand."
92,0.6,"At the same time, as at 31 December 2020, the companies updated the remaining provision for onerous contracts to . PLN 76 394 thousand. This provision relates primarily to GD price lists in the amount of PLN 69 051 thousand. On the . other hand, as at 31 December 2020, no necessity arose to create a provision for onerous contracts in terms of G tariff. . On the basis of the household tariff for 2021, approved by the ERO President in December 2020, the companies will gain . revenues from the sale of electricity fully covering the reasonable costs of doing business in this area."

The Company pursues policy of . diversification of financing instruments but first of all it seeks to secure financing and maintain the ability of the Group . companies to meet current and future liabilities in the short and long term.

111,0.7586206896551724,"The TAURON Group carries out a centralized finance management policy, allowing effective management in this respect . on the Group level. Among others, the TAURON Group has adopted Liquidity management policy for the TAURON . Group, which facilitates optimization of liquidity management at the TAURON Group, reduces the risk of liquidity loss, as . well as financial expenses in the Group and in each company from the TAURON Group. Having implemented . appropriate projection standards, the TAURON Group can precisely determine its liquidity position and optimize the time . of obtaining funding, maturity and types of deposit instruments, as well as an appropriate level of the liquidity provision."

Changes in electricity demand resulted in a decrease in revenues mainly in the area of . electricity distribution and sales. The Group estimates that, in terms of the Distribution segment, the adverse impact . of the pandemic on EBITDA amounted to PLN 47 876 thousand, which is due to the loss of some sales volume to . non-household customers. With regard to the Sales segment, the estimated negative impact of the pandemic on . EBITDA amounted to PLN 77 179 thousand, due to the loss of margin associated with the decrease in electricity . sales and the need to balance the purchase position. In addition, the pandemic situation has led to a reduction in . production in the area of conventional generation and, consequently, to a fall in demand for hard coal and an . increase in coal stocks. In view of this situation, renegotiations were undertaken with coal suppliers on price and . quantity conditions for its purchase. In order to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on TAURON Group in . TAURON Wydobycie S.A., an agreement was signed between the Management Board of the company and the social . side, limiting working hours and reducing the remuneration of the company's Management Board and employees by . 20% in the period of three months starting from 1 May 2020. In turn, at TAURON Wytwarzanie S.A., an agreement . signed between the company's Management Board and the social side limited working hours and reduced the . remuneration of the company's Management Board and employees by 10% in the corresponding period.

126,0.6923076923076923,"• . Disturbances in economic activity in Poland caused financial difficulties for customers and contractors of the . TAURON Group. The situation was mitigated by regulatory measures in the introduction of successive anti-crisis . shields, which were aimed at maintaining liquidity and protecting jobs at Polish entrepreneurs. In the period from . March to December 2020, changes in the level of overdue receivables were observed in the first weeks of the . development of the pandemic. In the remainder of the year, past due receivables were broadly stable, with increased . migration of the balance of receivables into subsequent past due periods observed. In order to limit potential credit . losses, extended credit risk management criteria are applied, monitoring of receivables has been intensified and debt . collection activities have been stepped up. The COVID-19 pandemic has further affected the need for additional . allowances for expected credit losses of financial instruments and the remeasurement to fair value of loans granted. . This increased the Company's operating expenses by PLN 19 628 thousand and financial expenses by PLN 14 497 . thousand."
126,0.6153846153846154,"• . In terms of the market environment, increased volatility was observed in the prices of commodity instruments, in . particular electricity and CO2 emission allowances, which translated into an increase in the required security deposits . and, consequently, the level of cash committed for this purpose. In order to improve its liquidity position, the . Company has entered into guarantee limit agreements allowing it to provide the required collateral to the IRGiT in . non-cash form. The Company has also taken advantage of the anti-crisis shield solution by filing a declaration of . submission to enforcement with the IRGiT, thereby reducing the level of deposits made both in cash and in . established bank guarantees (this solution, in accordance with the Act, expired on 30 September 2020). In order to . further reduce the liquidity risk, the Company matched the delivery dates of the concluded forward contracts for CO2 . emission allowances with their redemption dates and decided to conclude new contracts exclusively on the OTC . market. A capping system for TAURON expenditure has also been introduced."
126,0.8461538461538461,"• . In terms of financial instruments, a depreciation of the zloty and a fall in interest rates were observed, including an . intervention reduction in the NBP reference interest rate.

In the case of the investment in the construction of the 910 MW unit at Jaworzno and . the construction of the unit at EC Stalowa Wola, these occurred in the early stages of the pandemic as a result of the . introduction of strict controls on access to infrastructure and additional security procedures. With regard to the . construction of the 910 MW unit, COVID-19 was one of the reasons for amending the contract with the Consortium of . Rafako S.A. and Mostostal Warszawa S.A.

The scope of . the project covers high efficiency electrolysis of water vapor supported by fuel cells, in order to increase the . efficiency of the green hydrogen storage in the form of synthetic natural gas, with the use of CO2 captured from the . power generating units’ flue gas. The purpose of the pilot Power-to-Gas installation is to test innovative, high . efficiency technologies for the production of hydrogen and CO2 capture from boiler flue gas. The CO2 and hydrogen . obtained this way are blended and transformed into synthetic natural gas using the methanation installation. This . process will ultimately be powered by the surplus of cheap energy generated from the renewable sources during . the so-called load valleys (when the demand is reduced, e.g. at night). The technology is a promising solution for . storing electricity from non-controllable energy sources - wind farms (in particular, the planned off-shore farms) or . photovoltaic cells. The contractor for the pilot installation was selected in 2020 and the construction thereof began . at the Łaziska Power Plant."

The other consumers (the trading . companies outside TAURON Capital Group, the exchanges) accounted for less than 7.8% of the revenue and none . of them exceeded 4% of the total revenue from electricity sales. A decision was made in the third quarter of 2020 . to discontinue the trading activities with respect to intersystem exchange. This is due to the situation regarding the . restriction of importing options (transmission capacity available), which has been prevailing since the beginning of . 2020, the Company's trading strategy, as well as the planned changes with respect to the system for allocating of . the transmission capacity for intersystem exchange at the level of the Community electricity market (the planned . introduction of the Market Coupling mechanism for the Day-ahead and Intraday markets). In connection with the . above, the documents terminating the transmission contracts were submitted to the TSO in Germany (50Hertz .

The lowest price of oil was recorded in the second quarter of 2020, . while the highest price was observed in the first quarter of 2020, with the average quarterly price coming in at 33.39 . USD/bbl and 50.82 USD/bbl, respectively. The total Brent crude trading volume on the ICE exchange clocked in at . approx. 60 billion barrels in 2020, while it reached more than 64 billion barrels (-7.2%) a year earlier."
180,0.55,"The global events directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic were the main factors that had an impact on the . demand and supply on the oil markets. The impact of the pandemic hit the oil industry, which caused - for the first . time in history – the WTI oil prices to fall below zero in April 2020. The producers faced a large oversupply (glut) of . the commodity and began looking for a place to store the surplus, paying the recipient additional costs for the . storage of the commodity. In addition, the global demand for oil dropped sharply."
180,0.6,"The price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia also indirectly contributed to the fall in oil prices, which started in . March 2020. The dispute ended in April 2020, when OPEC and its allies agreed to reduce the total crude oil . production by 9.7 million barrels per day, initially for a period of two months starting from May 2020, and then to . limit (cap) its production cuts to 7.7 million barrels per day between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. In . November 2020, following the announcement by several pharmaceutical companies of the development of the . vaccines against COVID-19, the prices of Brent crude rose on average to approx. 44 USD/barrel. In December . 2020, OPEC and its allies announced that they would voluntarily cut production by 0.5 million barrels per day, i.e. . from 7.7 million to 7.2 million barrels per day starting from January 2021."

180,0.85,"The beginning of 2020 was characterized by weak sentiment on the international coal market largely caused by the . COVID-19 pandemic. The entire coal sector in the United States of America (USA) was in a difficult situation, as . the restrictions imposed on the manufacturing industry, triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly reduced . the demand for energy in the US and led to the lower volumes of purchase orders for that commodity from other . parts of the world."
180,1.0,"The Atlantic region was plunged into an increasing stagnation in the first half of 2020. Coal consumption in the West . European countries decreased as a consequence of measures introduced to slow down the spread of the COVID-. 19 pandemic."
180,0.75,"Important events that had an impact on the international coal markets in the second half of 2020 included in . particular: the decision of the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission, which on several occasions . prohibited state owned energy companies to import the Australian thermal coal, which was aimed at increasing the . prices of the domestic commodity, the disruptions of the coal supplies from the north-western Russia, from the port . of Murmansk, where the railway bridge used to transport the commodity collapsed, the depressed demand from . India, the strike in the Cerrejón coal mine in Colombia, lasting 3 months, which led to a reduction in the supply of . that commodity in the Atlantic region and the need to secure the hard coal supplies in the autumn before winter, . both in Europe as well as in Asia."
180,0.9,"At the end of 2020, the hard coal prices began to rise, which was the result of, among others: a decline in wind . energy production in Germany, an improving margin on the generation for coal fired electricity production, the rising . prices of natural gas and crude oil, as well as a prolonged deadlock regarding the resumption of the production in . Colombia."

December 2020, with the average volume weighted average monthly price coming in at 27.90 PLN/MWh and 81.29 . PLN/MWh, respectively. The reason for the low prices was primarily the COVID-19 pandemic, which translated into . the reduced demand for gas fuel as well as the oversupply (glut) prevailing on the global gas markets for most of . the year. The lowest price, i.e. 20.09 PLN/MWh, was recorded on May 5, 2020."
180,0.95,"The weighted average gas price on the Intraday Market (IDM), was lower by approx. 14.60 PLN/MWh than in 2019, . and clocked in at 54.52 PLN/MWh.

181,0.7777777777777777,"The reason for the lower average annual price of the CO2 emission allowances in 2020 was the sharp correction of . the prices in March. The drop in the prices was a consequence of the emergence of the first cases of the COVID-. 19 infection in Europe and in the US. Having been hit with the news of the shutdowns of international connections . and the lockdowns of a number of economies, the investors feared that the supply chains would be broken and the . economic slowdown would be severe, and, as a consequence, the demand for the EUA units would decline. Due . to the need to maintain financial liquidity, a number of companies were selling off the EUA units to generate . additional cash. The situation calmed down in April when the financial stimulus packages rescued many companies . from the crisis and led to a sharp rebound of the stock market indices and a recovery of the CO2 prices."
181,0.7916666666666667,"The increase in the demand was also impacted by the April purchases made in order to settle the CO2 emissions . for 2019. The European Parliament committees were intensely working in the second half of 2020 on the shape of . the new European climate law, the goal of which will be to introduce a legally binding target of achieving zero . greenhouse gas emissions at the level of the individual EU countries by 2050 - for this purpose, a high price of the . CO2 emission allowances and, ultimately, another revision of the EU ETS system will be necessary."
181,0.8611111111111112,"An important event affecting the CO2 prices was the announcement in the European Parliament of the proposed . new EU emissions reduction target by 2030 at a level of at least 55% as compared to 1990."

(including debt) will be fully included in the consolidated financial statements of TAURON Capital Group, while such . data may be excluded from the calculation of the gearing ratio for the needs of the loan agreements."

TAURON will indicate the SPVs that will be excluded from the calculation of the net debt/EBITDA ratio at the end . of the specific reporting periods. At the same time, a mechanism was implemented to enable TAURON to re-include . the SPV in the calculation of the net debt/EBITDA ratio."

Research conducted by specialized research . companies indicates that each zloty spent generates a 10-fold return. TAURON Capital Group had contracts . covering 10 sponsoring projects in place In 2020. The preliminary data on the advertising equivalents achieved for . the activities completed in 2020 demonstrate that the best results were achieved by the activities undertaken by the . Polish Volleyball League (Polska Liga Siatkówki)."
212,0.926470588235294,"The main objective of TAURON Capital Group’s sponsoring activities is to support its business goals defined in the . Strategy and the continuous strengthening of the brand's position as compared to the competition. TAURON Capital . Group’s sponsoring activities in 2020 were conducted based on TAURON Group’s Plan of Conducting Sponsoring . Activities in 2020 adopted by the Management Board of the Company and granted a positive opinion by the . Supervisory Board of the Company."
212,0.8529411764705883,"The sponsoring activities were carried out in 2020 based on the negotiated agreements, containing standardized . provisions. Each sponsoring agreement concluded includes provisions that obligate the contractors (counterparties) . to pay special attention to the business effect (the so-called success fee rule)."
212,0.8823529411764706,"In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a need to abandon some of the projects in 2020, amend the . current contracts and thus reduce the value of projects, as well as introduce replacement services. Most of the . events took place without the participation of the audience, based on the on-line formula, i.e. for example the . successive edition of the TAURON Nowa Muzyka (New Music) music festival. A large number of the projects . planned under the already concluded contracts were replaced with other proposals, while some of them were . canceled, which led to the decision to reduce the value of some contracts, e.g. the contract related to the . implementation of the TAURON Arena Kraków project."
212,0.7941176470588235,"The Company’s sponsoring activities are monitored, analyzed and reported on an on-going basis to the Company’s . Management Board and Supervisory Board, among others based on the detailed reports on the implementation of . the sponsoring contracts The surveys and analyses are conducted in quarterly, 6-month and annual cycles by the . specialized external entities and the internal oversight. In accordance with the procedures implemented at TAURON . Capital Group, the effectiveness of the activities conducted is assessed on a regular basis based on the opinion . polls, by measuring the size and value of the brand's exposure in the media in the context of the activities conducted, . as well as by measuring the impact on the pro-sales attitudes, including the reporting of the results achieved."

(understood here as a comparison of the advertising equivalent to the expenditures on the implementation of the . contract) at a level of approximately 9.03 was obtained.

The task of the Risk Committee is to set norms and standards for risk management at TAURON . Capital Group and oversight of the risk management process effectiveness. Within the Risk Committee two separate . teams are set up, one for the trading (commercial) risk area and the other for the financial and credit risk area. .

232,0.7647058823529411,"The material risks in the Mining Segment also include threats stemming from the regulatory environment, including . the gradual introduction of the new environmental requirements tightening the emission standards for the coal fired . power plants, which will result in a decline of the demand for coal with low quality parameters."
232,0.823529411764706,"The Mining Segment will also be materially affected by the climate policy that assumes a departure from the coal . based generation technology in order to reduce pollution and achieve climate neutrality in the EU in the long term, . which will, in effect, lead to the need to gradually phase out coal production. The level of demand for hard coal is . also impacted by the issues related to the volume of electricity imported to Poland, observed in recent years, as . well as the situation associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the decrease in demand in the Polish Power . System (KSE). In addition, the withdrawal of the financial institutions from financing of the assets based on the fossil . fuels has been intensifying recently, which results in the curtailment of the possibilities of financing the new . investment projects in the Mining Segment."

232,0.7941176470588235,"As part of the market risk, the material risk factors include: the gradually declining CDS margin and the plans to . integrate the European electricity market (increase in the electricity imports). In addition, the development of . renewable energy technologies and the ever growing share of RES in meeting the demand for electricity have a . material impact on the Generation Line of Business, leading to the pushing of the conventional generating units out . of the market. Also, the electricity imports and the introduction of the new coal fired capacity into the system, with . the efficiency much higher than the efficiency of the 200 MW units, means that the use of such generating units in . the Generation Segment will be declining. A decrease in electricity demand is also observed in 2020, as a result of . the epidemic in Poland. The above factors, in turn, lead to the decrease in demand for hard coal, resulting in a . reduction in its purchases from the external suppliers."
232,0.676470588235294,"With respect to the operational factors, the most material threat is the risk of not achieving the planned availability . (dispatchability) rate of the units, which is closely related to the individual units’ failure rate, high variability of the . units’ loads and the higher frequency of start-ups or the use of inadequate quality fuel."
232,0.8823529411764706,"A failure to meet the planned availability rate of the units may also result in the inability to meet the capacity . obligation, which, if it is not possible to reserve capacity, may result in the assessing of penalties on the Generation . Segment’s subsidiaries."
232,0.6470588235294117,"The Generation Segment’s operations are also materially impacted by the climate factors, including the EU’s climate . policy, that assumes the ultimate departure from the coal fired generation technology in order to reduce pollution, . which, as a consequence, will cause a drop in the profitability of this operating segment.

The surplus of the impairment charges related to the carrying amount of the . subsidiaries’ stocks and shares and the revaluation of the loans granted to the subsidiaries in 2020 amounted to a . total of PLN 2 042 million, as compared to PLN 1 520 million in 2019."

The analyses completed demonstrated that the setting up of the provision in the Company’s . financial statements had been justified. Moreover, higher electricity purchase costs were recorded in 2020, due to . the increase in the volume, with higher electricity purchase prices. Another factor was the costs of the other . operating activities, which amounted to PLN 17 million, as compared to PLN 5 million in 2019, and were mainly . incurred for the donations, including for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, the construction of the temporary . hospitals at the request of the Ministry of the State Assets, and the setting up of a balance sheet provision related . to the claim from TAURON Capital Group against the Company with regard to the mandatory  repurchase of the . shares (squeeze)."
238,0.64,"The costs of sales and overheads in the amount of PLN 138 million were lower by 5% as compared to 2019, which . was, to a large degree, due to the dissolving (release) of the provision related to the energy relief, the lower level . of the implementation of the tasks related to promotion and marketing, as well as of the project activities, caused . by the limitations stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic."
238,0.68,"The costs of the financing activities came in at PLN 4 189 million and they were higher by 108% as compared to . 2019, which was to, the largest extent, due to the following events:"
238,0.84,"1.  recognition of the write-down, related to the revaluation to fair value (mark to market) of the fixed assets . classified as held for sale, in the amount of PLN 1 394 million, in connection with classifying the above assets . as held for sale."

238,0.44,"3.  surplus of the negative FX exchange differences over the positive ones in the amount of PLN 303 million, which . is related to the valuation of the Company's liabilities due to the debt denominated in EUR, i.e. a loan received . from a subsidiary, subordinated bonds and the EURO bonds. The euro exchange rate went up from 4.2585 . PLN/EUR to the level of 4.6148 PLN/EUR in the reporting period,. In the comparable period, the surplus of the . positive FX exchange differences over the negative ones amounted to PLN 29 million."
238,0.8,"In addition, the Company recognized the net cost of the revaluation of the loans in the amount of PLN 1 453 million, . which is a slightly higher amount than the cost recognized in the income statement for 2019. The costs of this item . resulted from:"
238,0.4,"1.  valuation of the loans granted to the TAURON Wydobycie subsidiary, and as a consequence the financial result . of the Company was charged with the negative valuation in the total amount of PLN 1 159 million,"
238,0.76,"2.  valuation of the loans granted to the Elektrociepłownia Stalowa Wola S.A. joint venture in the total amount of .

All of the new transactions concluded on the OTC . market will be used for the purpose of performing the retirement obligation by TAURON Capital Group’s . generation subsidiaries. The above transactions led to a charge to the Generation Segment’s EBITDA result . in the amount of PLN 111 million. At the same time, the completed purchase of the volume with the delivery . date in March 2021 from the counterparties on the OTC market, taking into account the decrease of the CO2 . emission allowances prices at the time of the transaction, led to the reduction of the costs of TAURON Capital .

The need to set up the above provision for the G tariff stemmed from the adoption, . for the calculation of the sales price for such consumers for 2020, of the parameters specified in the request . (summons) of the President of the ERO, the approval of which in December 2019 results in the lack of the ability . to generate revenue from the supply of electricity in the amount covering the justified costs of conducting the . business operations in this regard. The price level approved by the decision of the President of the ERO for the . G tariff group for 2020 was also a significant reason for the losses on the GD price lists, for which the provision . was set up. Some of the product based contracts in the household segment link the rates for the electricity with . the G tariff price, and therefore also make it impossible to generate sales revenue in the amount that would . cover the full variable costs of the business operations conducted. At the same time, the TAURON Sprzedaż . subsidiary submitted, on January 7, 2020, an application for the approval of a change of the electricity tariff for . the G tariff groups’ customers for 2020, which aims to pass on (cover) all of the justified costs that were not . accepted in the application approved in December 2019. By way of the decision of July 8, 2020, the President . of the ERO refused to approve the change in the electricity tariff for such customers. On July 31, 2020, the . Management Board of TAURON Sprzedaż filed an appeal with the Competition and Consumer Protection Court . against the Decision of the President of the ERO of July 8, 2020. At the same time, as of December 31, 2020, . the Company updated the remaining part of the provision for onerous contracts. This provision is applicable, . first and foremost, to the GD price lists. However, as of December 31, 2020, there was no need to set up a . provision for onerous contracts in respect of the G tariff. On the basis of the tariff for the households for 2021 . approved by the President of the ERO in December 2020, the Company will be generating revenue from the . supply of electricity that will fully cover the justified costs of conducting the business operations in this regard,"

It is assumed that the recovery from the . crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic will take place already in 2021. With respect to Poland the GDP . growth rate is forecast to reach 3.6%. Poland’s return to the moderate growth will be possible thanks to the easing . of the restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the return to normality of a number of sectors of the economy, . government aid programs, as well as a slow recovery of the major trade partners."
269,0.6976744186046511,"According to the forecasts of the NBP, published at the end of 2020, a 3.5% Poland’s GDP growth rate decline was . recorded in 2020, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is assumed that the GDP will grow at a 4.9% . clip in 2021, while the elevated uncertainty and the restrictions on the activities of the companies related thereto will . remain a factor hindering the recovery of the demand for investments over the time frame covered by the projection. . In the opinion of the NBP believes that the economic recovery in 2021-2022 is conditional upon the assumed, slow . normalization of the epidemic situation, the recovery of the economic activity abroad and an improvement in the . prospects for the private sector’s demand (consumption). The projection scenario assumes a relatively low rate of . economic growth in the years 2021-2022, taking into account the significant scale of the decline in the economic . activity in 2021. The projections indicate that the pace of the recovery in the domestic economic activity will be . curbed by the probably recurring increases in the number of infections resulting in the reintroduction of the . temporary constraints on the functioning of the economy and postponing of the lifting of the epidemic restrictions in . force. Also, high uncertainty related to the further course of the COIVD-19 pandemic will remain a factor curtailing . the growth in the household spending and the capital expenditures over the time frame covered by the projection."

269,0.813953488372093,"It is expected that the financial situation of the Generation Segment over the next few years will improve, as . compared to the current situation, mainly due to the commissioning of the 910 MWe unit in 2020 and due to the . revenue from the capacity market. The additional revenue from the capacity market starting from 2021 will allow for . compensating the expenditures incurred for the required refurbishments of the generating units in order to adapt . them to the BAT Conclusions. In order to improve the results of the segment the activities aimed at improving the . cost efficiency thereof will be continued throughout the entire line of business. On the other hand, the demanding . market situation and the continuing upward trend of the CO2 emission allowances’ prices carry the risk of the . degradation of the 1st degree margin on electricity and heat."

According to SolarPower Europe, Poland was ranked in the fourth place in the EU in 2020 in terms of . the growth of the new photovoltaic capacity.

Capital Group as well as the covenants required by the financial institutions, and also leads to the reduction of the . administrative (overhead) costs. The central corporate financing model also enables acquiring the funding sources . that are not available for the individual subsidiaries. The Company is also considering implementing the method of . acquiring funding using the project finance formula with respect to the RES projects. In 2020, the Company obtained . approvals from the financial institutions regarding the exclusion of the financing obtained by TAURON’s selected . special purpose vehicles (SPV) for the implementation of the RES investment projects from the net debt / EBITDA . ratio. In case of the project finance solutions, the funds will be obtained directly by the companies implementing the . investment projects in the field of renewable energy sources (RES) in cooperation with TAURON - TAURON will be . performing the arrangement (organizational) functions. The above action should enable greater use of debt . financing as part of the green turn strategy implemented by TAURON."

273,0.8571428571428571,"The liquidity management is supported by the implemented cash pool mechanism. Its overarching goal is to ensure . TAURON Capital Group’s ongoing financial liquidity, while at the same time curbing the costs of the short term . external financing and minimizing the financial costs related to maintaining cash surpluses on the bank accounts. . Owing to the functioning of the cash pool structure TAURON Capital Group’s subsidiaries, facing short term funding . deficits, may use the funds of the subsidiaries generating the financial surpluses, without the need to acquire the . external financing."
273,0.7142857142857143,"Both, the financing policy, as well as TAURON Capital Group’s liquidity management policy conducted by TAURON . are aimed, apart from increasing the efficiency of managing TAURON Capital Group’s finances, first of all, at . eliminating threats of curtailment or loss of TAURON Capital Group’s financial liquidity. The guaranteed sources of . the financing, obtained with an appropriate lead time, effectively eliminate the risk of TAURON Capital Group losing . its liquidity. The Company is pursuing a policy of diversifying the financing instruments, but, first and foremost, it is . seeking to secure the financing and maintain the ability of TAURON Capital Group’s subsidiaries to meet the current . and future liabilities in the short and long term."

The above mentioned measure curtailed the costs of the guarantees acquired . and curbed the total number of actions required to obtain a guarantee."

322,0.75,"An increase in the number of COVID-19 infection cases was observed in Poland in 2020. Therefore, a number of . restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the COVID-19 infections were . introduced in the country. This situation led to the disruptions in the economic and administrative system in Poland . and worldwide. As a result, the epidemic significantly curbed the economic activity, affecting the operations of the . manufacturing plants and the small and medium sized enterprise segment companies. As a consequence, in the . medium and long term it should be expected that the epidemic will continue to affect the condition of the national, . the European, as well as the global economy, making a negative impact on the economic growth in Poland in 2021 . and in the subsequent years."
322,0.5,"The COVID-19 related situation had a material impact upon the level of demand for electricity in the Polish Power . System (KSE) and, as a consequence, on TAURON Capital Group’s electricity distribution and supply volumes. In . the second half of 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the domestic demand was milder than in the first . half of 2020. The steepest decline in electricity consumption in Poland took place in the second quarter of 2020, . clocking in at as much as 8.5%, while the annual consumption of electricity in the country decreased by approx. . 2.3%, as compared to the corresponding period of 2019. The changes in the demand for electricity resulted in a . drop of the revenues, mainly in the electricity distribution and supply lines of business. TAURON Capital Group . estimates that in the Distribution Segment the negative impact of the pandemic on EBITDA stood at PLN 47 876 . 000, which was due to the loss of a part of the sales volume to the consumers other than the households. With . respect to the Supply Segment, the estimated negative impact of the pandemic on EBITDA came in at PLN 77 179 . 000, which was due to the loss of margin related to the decline in electricity supply and the need to balance the buy . position. The pandemic situation observed also led to a fall of the production volume in the conventional generation . line of business and, consequently, to a drop of the demand for hard coal and an increase in its inventory levels. . Because of such developments the negotiations with the coal suppliers were undertaken in order to renegotiate the . coal purchase contract terms related to the pricing and quantities. In order to curtail the negative impact of the . pandemic on TAURON Capital Group, at TAURON Wydobycie subsidiary an agreement was signed between the . Management Board of the company and the social partners (workforce) limiting the working time and reducing the . compensation of the Management Board and the employees of the company by 20% for the period of three months, . starting from May 1, 2020. On the other hand, at TAURON Wytwarzanie subsidiary an agreement signed between . the Management Board of the company and the social partners (workforce) reduced the working time and the . compensation of the Management Board and the employees of the company by 10% in the same period of time. . The above agreements made it possible to cut down the costs and obtain funds under the solutions provided under . the anti-crisis shield due to the reduced working time of the employees."
322,0.625,"The customers of TAURON Capital Group, i.e. private individuals, small and medium sized enterprises, as well as . large entities, can be expected to experience financial disturbances in connection with the effects of the pandemic, . which may lead to problems with the payment of their current accounts payable for electricity, heat and gas. In . particular, an increase in the number of customer requests for an extension of the payment or splitting the payment . into installments can be observed. Also an increase in the overdue accounts receivable is visible, resulting from the . introduction of the restrictions in the operations of the businesses in the period from March to May. In order to . reduce the above risk, the credit risk management criteria have been tightened and the soft debt collection activities . have been intensified."

In the period from March to December 2020, the changes in the balance . of the overdue accounts receivable were observed in the first weeks of the pandemic’s spread.

With regard to the construction of the 910 MW unit, the COVID-. 19 pandemic was one of the reasons for the amendment of the agreement with the Rafako S.A. and Mostostal . Warszawa S.A.

338,0.7391304347826088,"the past year was extremely intense, important and rich in experiences for us. The recent months have . been a time of a number of challenges and changes, but also an opportunity to implement specific goals . that we can confidently call today a joint success. We adapted to the new realities quickly and efficiently, . and the introduced procedures related to the functioning of companies operating in the conditions of the . Covid-19 pandemic allowed us to ensure continuity of production and supply of electricity to our . customers."
338,0.34782608695652173,"The development of renewable energy sources has invariably remained our priority. We completed the . implementation of the first photovoltaic farm located on the Group’s post-industrial land in Jaworzno in December . 2020. The electricity generated by this installation will power more than two thousand households."
338,0.43478260869565216,"We are also operating nine onshore wind farms with the total capacity of 381 MW, and by 2025 we want to increase . this potential to more than 1000 MW of installed capacity. In line with international trends, we have connected . almost 100 000 RES micro-installations with the total capacity of 658 MW to our distribution grid, as a result of our . activities with respect to prosumer energy development"
338,0.6956521739130435,"Last year, we also completed the construction of our final projects in the conventional energy field - a 910 MW coal-. fired unit in Jaworzno and a 450 MW CCGT unit in Stalowa Wola. They are efficient, modern generation units, . adapted to meet demanding environmental protection standards, that will constitute an important element of . Poland's energy security."
338,0.6086956521739131,"As in previous years, also in 2020 we undertook a number of initiatives aimed at guaranteeing the financial . resources required to ensure TAURON Group’s sustainable development. At this point, it is worth to mention . Poland’s first issue of sustainable development bonds, as part of which we issued five-year bonds worth  . PLN 1 billion, with the proceeds to be spent on the Group’s energy transition."
338,0.391304347826087,"We want the Report that we are submitting to you to be a comprehensive and transparent document presenting the . relationships between the Group's business model and the Strategy described by the non-financial indicators as . well as the due diligence policies and procedures required for the implementation thereof. The discussion of the . risks and methods how to manage them is an important part of the Report."
338,0.5652173913043478,"The layout and content of the publication are based on the structure and guidelines of the international reporting . standard GRI (Global Reporting Initiative). The goal of this comprehensive presentation of our operations is to make . the stakeholders, especially investors, financial institutions, insurers and customers familiar with TAURON Capital . Group’s activities and directions of expansion."
338,0.6521739130434783,"Despite the numerous challenges facing the Polish energy sector, I am convinced that that the consistent . implementation of the assumptions of the Green Turn of TAURON initiated in May 2019 will have a positive . impact upon the TAURON Group’s market position and prospects."
338,0.5217391304347826,"In 2021, we are focusing on further expansion and modern solutions, while not forgetting our previous . accomplishments. We will strive to maintain financial stability, take into account the interests of stakeholders, . provide employees with a sense of security and tangible benefits for investors."
338,0.4782608695652174,"During the past year, I was able to find out multiple times that TAURON's success depends primarily on the people . who make up the company - their ability to cope with adverse circumstances, the ability to respond flexibly and . make the right decisions. They are the ones who deserve special thanks."

The Group was organized in a long chain of . operations covering virtually all of the value building stages: from acquiring fuel, up to supplying the product to the . final consumer. Such organization allows to impact the quality of the processes implemented at each stage of value . creation, and thus optimize and, if required, change the way of doing business so as to respond to the current and . future challenges. TAURON Group is changing towards the implementation of the assumptions of the European . Green Deal, which is reflected, inter alia, in the Green Turn of TAURON. For the energy industry, the climate impact . includes both, weather related occurrences, as well as regulatory changes and changes in customer attitudes. All . of this is not without significance for the business model and Strategy,"
382,0.5454545454545454,"In line with the European Green Deal, the transition of the European economy towards a sustainable future takes . place on many levels. TAURON Group recognizes the risk of significant changes in the regulatory area, both at the . European, as well as the national level, aimed at minimizing the negative impact on the climate by introducing . further restrictions for coal based power generation, mainly tightening of the climate regulations and the departure . of the financial institutions and insurers from the cooperation with entities operating coal assets. The above is the . main determinant for the development of RES at TAURON Group, as well as for the implementation of the principles . of the so-called circular economy. However, one should be aware of Poland’s current energy mix, including that of . TAURON Group, based on fossil fuels, historically associated with the large coal resources held, ensuring energy . security. The departure of the energy industry from that model will be a process that must be spread over time and . for which funds will be required to provide investment opportunities and activities mitigating the social implications . of the changes taking place."
382,0.6363636363636364,"In order to standardize the approach to financing environmentally sustainable investments a framework for financial . market participants was created at the European Union level that allows for classifying economic activity as . environmentally sustainable. Such an approach, presented mainly in the European Commission Communication . 2019/C 209/01 and in the Taxonomy document of June 2019, as well as in the Regulations of the European . Parliament and of the Council no. 2019/2088 and 2020/852, allows for a uniform indication which investments and . consequently, the revenues, can be qualified as sustainable and thus contribute to the achievement of the . environmental objectives. Contributions to mitigating climate change include, among others: generation and . distribution of electricity from renewable sources. In this respect, TAURON is gradually increasing the share of . production from renewable sources thanks to investments in wind and photovoltaic power plants and the . modernization of hydropower plants. TAURON is also implementing a distribution grid modernization and expansion . program, thanks to which it is possible to connect more renewable sources, including the prosumer ones. In 2020, . nearly 100 thousand prosumer installations were connected to TAURON Dystrybucja’s grid with a total capacity of . more than 650 MW, the cumulative capacity of prosumer installations connected to TAURON Dystrybucja’s grid is . more than 970 MW. The use of the best available technologies can also be considered as a contribution to mitigating . climate change - such a solution is the 910 MW unit in Jaworzno, commissioned in 2020, which is a unit with a . supercritical parameters boiler providing the highest possible efficiency, which will replace the old generation assets . with higher emissions."
382,0.7272727272727273,"In accordance with the Update of the Strategic Directions, adopted in May 2019, TAURON Group will reduce its . emissions by more than 50% by 2030, as shown in Figure no. 14."

TAURON Group reduces its negative impact on the environment and climate thanks . to the continuous modernization of conventional generating units, expansion of capacity in renewable energy . sources, capturing and economic use of methane from coal deposits, limiting losses in electricity and heat . distribution or retiring ineffective coal-fired units."
383,0.5,"Positive effects can also be indicated, such as water damming and its accumulation during periods of heavy rainfall . and the release during periods of drought, which not only allows for reducing the effects of drought, but also reduces . the risk of inundation or flooding. The expansion of the heating infrastructure makes it possible to replace non-. ecological individual coal-fired boilers with district heating. Modernization and expansion of the electricity distribution . grid improves the reliability of electricity supply and enables connecting an ever increasing number of distributed . electricity producers using renewable sources, including prosumers. As a result of its investment activities TAURON . Group’s production of electricity from renewable sources is gradually increasing, contributing to the mitigation of . climate change.

More and . more customers will accept higher electricity costs as long as it is produced without the negative impact on the . climate. Social pressure and the EU regulations are causing Poland to introduce increasingly more stringent . environmental standards and a rising taxation of the CO2 emissions (fees for the CO2 emissions). The continuous . increase in the CO2 emission allowances prices is also associated with the use of the regulatory mechanisms . leading to the reduced supply of the emission allowances, the EU’s commitments to reduce the emissions by 55% . in 2030 will be implemented through the supply controls – that is why the development of low- and zero-emission . energy sources is so important.

It should be mentioned that at the EU level the offshore strategy assumes the construction . of more than 300 GW of capacity by 2050 as part of the development of offshore wind energy. In order to take full . advantage of this potential, it is necessary to develop technologies that enable energy storage.

Prosumer installations and large-scale installations operating today and . forecast to be launched cause and will cause a still higher price volatility. Electricity during the peak hours of . renewable energy production will be cheap, therefore it is likely to worsen the economic efficiency of such . installations. The solution to this issue is technology diversification. TAURON Group does not focus on one . renewable energy technology. Another solution to this problem can be energy storage technologies - both using . storage facilities based on electrochemical cells as well as based on the production and storage of hydrogen using . redundant, cheap electricity. As of today, both of these energy storage technologies are being developed by . TAURON Group."

Rising energy efficiency of the customers and growing production from the prosumer installations lead to a . drop of the demand for the electricity generated by the system (utility scale) sources. This trend, combined with the . rising prices of the fossil fuels and/or the increase in the environmental and climate costs (CO2 emission and the . costs of the other emissions) related thereto, causes a shift in the role of the system (utility scale) power plants (in . particular, the coal fired ones) from the position of primary sources to that of complementary and stabilizing ones."

The . modern 910 MW coal-fired unit in Jaworzno, commissioned in 2020, is the last coal-based generation unit, and the . investment plans envisage the expansion of capacity in onshore and offshore wind technologies and the . construction of photovoltaic farms. The first effects of implementing such strategy included doubling of the wind . farms capacity in 2019."
386,0.5,"The nature of the transmission systems and distribution grids is changing.

The technical solutions and network topologies are also significantly affected by the . extreme weather conditions. Their increasing number and intensity makes it necessary to use the solutions resilient . against, in particular, strong winds. This leads to the need to build cable and insulated networks (for the medium . and low voltage grids) and upgrade the overhead networks, especially in the built-up and forest areas. TAURON . Dystrybucja, as the Distribution System Operator, has, for years, been, implementing investment tasks to improve . the quality and reliability of electricity supplies, mainly through automation, modernization of the existing grid and . its expansion. Such activities improve network management, allow for a faster response to the grid disruptions, . enable connecting further renewable energy sources and, inter alia, thanks to cabling, they reduce the possibility . of a negative impact of weather and climate phenomena on the grid."

Temperature rise associated with climate change has a negative impact on the production from . hydroelectric power plants (due to the hydrological drought), but thanks to the development of photovoltaic and . wind generation, including off-shore, the Group will be able to use such renewable generation sources even to a . larger degree. In the long run, TAURON Group's impact on natural resources will be decreasing, both due to the . need to meet the expected tightening of environmental requirements and climate policy, as a result of investments . into new, low- and zero-emission energy sources, but also thanks to the permanent shutdown of obsolete . conventional units.  .  . Climate change, in particular the rise in temperature, mainly in the winter months, reduces the need for heat and . electricity for the heating purposes. When planning the consumption of natural resources, the Group will have to . take into account such changes. Being aware of the non-renewable nature of the hard coal sources consumed, the . Group uses them in a responsible and efficient manner. The Group's transition towards low- and zero-emission . energy will impact the business model, shifting revenue generation place within the value chain. In turn, the . implementation of this scenario will have an impact on human capital, causing the need to change the qualifications . of some employees and hire people with new skills. Thanks to the transition being implemented, there is also a . chance that dedicated and qualified persons might become interested in working at TAURON Group, as they would . be offered an opportunity to build career paths in the new renewable technology fields. The challenges associated . with therewith and the opportunity to work in a stable industry will become one of the factors changing the perception . of the energy sector by young generations, as an industry viewed as modern and climate neutral.

The most important of them, from . the point of view of the Group's business operations, are the climate and environment related regulatory changes. . The global warming, increase of the pollution and a serious smog problem in Poland that have been observed for . years, are forcing specific actions to minimize the negative impact of business operations on the environment."
395,0.41666666666666663,"Short term outlook"
395,0.5,"It is assumed that the power sector will focus its efforts on the development of renewable sources. On one hand, . this will be the result of an increase in prices on the wholesale electricity market, and on the other hand, it will also . be the consequence of the strong support for the development of renewable energy sources and the growing cost . competitiveness of such technology as compared to the ever more expensive conventional electricity generation. . The noticeable fast growth of photovoltaics in Poland is primarily associated with the cost competitiveness of the . technology and the launch of extensive support programs that significantly reduce investment costs. The possibility . of achieving at least partial independence of rising electricity prices is also important. Binding national RES targets . for 2020 prompted Poland to introduce a system of incentives, among others for the prosumers, that result in . increased interest in this technology. The development of prosumer photovoltaics installations is possible, among . others, thanks to the funding from the government programs. According to the Polish Energy Policy (PEP), it is . assumed that the achievable capacity in PV technologies will reach 4.9 GW in 2025. In the short term, the installed . capacity in onshore wind technology will also increase - according to the assumptions of the PEP, the estimated . onshore wind power in Poland will stand at approx. 9.6 GW in 2025. The amendment to the distance act (the so-. called 10H) can be an impulse spurring further development of wind energy. Offshore wind farms are a new and . promising investment direction. According to investors' declarations, the production of electricity from the first wind . farm in the Polish zone of the Baltic Sea will start as early as 2025. The most advanced works are carried out by . PGE, PKN Orlen and Polenergia, and the grid connection conditions were issued for approx. 10.6 GW of capacity. . According to the PEP 2040, offshore capacity will stand at approx. 0.7 GW by 2025."
395,0.375,"The pressure to decarbonize the energy sector, observed in recent years, is gaining momentum, which is reflected . in the regulations aimed at increasing environmental requirements for the coal-fired units, deepening the decline of . their economic profitability, and in many cases resulting in a permanent lack of profitability. The effects of the . pandemic lead to a faster loss of competitiveness of the conventional sources than previously assumed and the . need to intensify activities allowing for a faster development of renewable electricity generation technologies. . Additionally, a change of the approach of the financial sector leading to lending only to environmentally sustainable . investments will accelerate the transition of the energy sector. The estimates included in the PEP indicate that . approx. 2.6 GW of capacity will be retired from the national system in 2021-2025. Hence, the share of the individual . sources in Poland's generation mix will change. It should be emphasized, however, that despite the growing number . of renewable energy installations, coal will continue to be the basic fuel in the domestic energy sector until 2025."

Despite the expected decline in the energy intensity of the Polish economy, stabilization of the economic . growth rate and the improvement of energy efficiency, there will be an increase in electricity consumption per capital. . This will be the consequence of the development of electromobility and the wider spreading of the use of electricity, . for example, for heating purposes in connection with counteracting low emissions. The electrification of heating . (combined with an increase of the importance of district heating) will be rising along with a growth of environmental . awareness and the intensification of activities related to smog reduction. In the coming years, the development of . new energy storage technologies to a level that would enable their cost efficient implementation on a system-wide . scale should not be expected. Significant regulatory restrictions on the use of fossil fuels for electricity production . and energy price volatility due to the large share of uncontrollable (intermittent) sources can be an impulse for the . wider spreading and use of energy storage facilities for system purposes. The nature of transmission systems and . distribution grids is changing from the traditional direction of energy flow from the power plant to the transmission . system, and further to the distribution grid and customers, to increasing flows in the opposite direction, i.e. from the . low voltage grids to the higher voltage grids. This forces undertaking investment activities aimed at grid metering, . including data transmission and IT systems supporting network management in order to maintain stability through . flow control (load capacity of network elements), voltage and short-circuit power control. The low and medium . voltage networks require large expenditures on modernization, so that they can absorb the avalanche of distributed . generation installations.

As regards the development of wind capacity until 2030, the PEP 2040 indicates an increase in offshore . wind installations’ capacity to approx. 3.8 GW, and in onshore wind installations’ capacity - approx. 9.6 GW. By . 2030, further shutdowns of unprofitable coal-fired units will take place. However, there is a chance for large, modern . conventional power generating units, the main role of which will be to stabilize the national power system. However, . it is assumed that their functioning will be directly dependent on the condition of climate and environment at the end . of the third decade of the century. The expansion of flexible gas-fired units is also considered. It is estimated in the . PEP that approx. 4 GW of generation capacity will be retired in the 2026-2030 time frame. As a consequence it is . forecast that the share of coal in the national energy mix will decrease significantly."

397,0.5,"The most important factors affecting the level of electricity demand include a further improvement of energy . efficiency and, at the same time, still large potential for electricity consumption growth. Consumer awareness will . be increasing further in connection with the digitization processes, access to the prosumer installations and smart . grid solutions. An ever broader range of services based on the smart grid infrastructure, in particular smart meters, . is assumed. The role of the demand side management services (DSR/DSM) will also increase, which will largely . result from the development of smart technologies and market mechanisms. Due to the avalanche growth of . prosumer installations, there will be a need to further develop transmission systems and distribution grids in order . to adapt them to greater load variability, as well as to support bi-directional flows. A great opportunity is the growing . awareness of threats to air quality resulting from low emissions and transportation. The generation sector, with the . introduction of appropriate regulations, may become the greatest beneficiary of changes in the way energy is used . for heating and transportation. At the same time, it will be a challenge for distribution grids and district heating . networks, which will have to take into account an increase in loads. Growing energy awareness in combination with . increasing energy costs will cause more and more interest in energy efficiency, energy saving and in-house . production of energy from RES. Economic incentives and better technologies will result in the intensification of . thermo-modernization activities and increased purchases of less and less energy-consuming devices (including in . households). Additionally, the popularity of pro-ecological behavior will grow. More and more customers will accept . the higher cost of electricity, provided it comes from ecological generation sources."

397,0.41666666666666663,"According to available forecasts, the role of the renewable sources will be steadfastly growing at the expense of the . conventional ones in the long term. Renewable energy sources are gaining their share in the global energy system . faster than any other fuel in history. The British conglomerate BP, in its Annual Energy Outlook 2020, estimates . that by 2040 renewable energy sources will be the main source of energy in the world, and in addition, the production . of electricity from the wind and PV sources will dominate in all of 3 scenarios for the development of the electricity . production market (Rapid, Net Zero, Business-as-usual). Renewable energy will be pushing out coal-based energy . over the next two decades and will replace coal as the main source of electricity generation in 2040. In the longer . term, there will also be a significant transition of our national energy mix by increasing the share of renewable . energy sources to more than 60% by 2040, as well as potentially nuclear energy and a simultaneous further decline . in the share of carbon sources. Taking into account the rising costs of coal-based energy as a result of the climate . policy, its importance will be marginalized. In the time frame up to 2050, the greatest challenge for Poland will be . to ensure stable electricity supplies to support the country's economic growth with increasing wealth levels, with the . simultaneous need for energy transition through investments in low-emission technologies. The future of the energy . sector will depend not only on its environmental impact, but also on the required adaptations to climate change. . Changes in climatic conditions will have an impact on the conditions of electricity distribution or changes in the . demand for electricity and heat. Infrastructure will require preparation for the effects of extreme weather and climate . related events, which may cause direct damage (e.g. hurricanes, intense storms, hail, rime and snowfall may . damage transmission and distribution lines), as well as indirect damage, being the long-term consequences of . extreme weather and climate related events (e.g. droughts or floods) ). In the long term, the possibility of the . emergence of breakthrough technologies on the market that can significantly affect the energy business, e.g. fuel . cells, should be taken into account. It is forecast that hydrogen technologies will be spreading widely in energy, . manufacturing industry and transportation, ammonia will be used on a large scale as one of the hydrogen fuels, . energy storage technologies will be significantly developed and new energy transmission technologies will be . developed. In the scenario with no breakthrough technologies, the energy sector will most likely expand in an . evolutionary manner, based on the already known and commercialized technologies."

397,0.75,"estimated for that time frame exceeds 2 C, then we are forecasting a further tightening of environmental standards . towards a substantial reduction of the CO2 emissions and extremely stringent emission standards for nitrogen and . sulfur oxides as well as mercury and dust. Tightening climate policy will result in a reduction in the supply of the . CO2 emission allowances under the ETS, which will lead to a significant increase in the prices of these allowances. . In the event that global temperature forecasts indicate an increase below 2 C, a scenario where high-efficiency . profitable coal assets will be maintained is possible, with a simultaneous reduction of emissions through the . development of low and zero-emission generation sources and limited expansion of coal fired assets, conditioned . on the demand for coal fuel and the possibility of obtaining it at competitive costs."

402,0.75,"TAURON Group’s Strategy, along with the Update of the Strategic Directions, is in line with the market and . regulatory trends identified in the time frame up to 2025. Until 2025 TAURON Group will focus on ensuring financial . stability by increasing operational efficiency and optimizing processes as well as on a sustainable transition related . to the change of the Group's energy mix towards reducing emissions. This plan will be implemented through the . gradual shutdown of obsolete coal-fired units and the development of low- and zero-emission sources. The main . result of the Group's activities will be a change in the energy mix so that low and zero emission sources will . constitute approximately 28% of the installed capacity in 2025. At the same time, TAURON will work on improving . the quality of distribution services and developing the sales offering."
402,0.5,"In the medium term TAURON Group will focus on further reductions of emissions through investments in low- and . zero-emission sources, while keeping only modern coal-fired units in the production portfolio. The modernization . and expansion of the grid will continue to be an important investment area. TAURON Group is planning to gradually . shut down 200 MW coal-fired units in the years 2025-2030. In line with the Group's Strategy the electricity generation . segment’s main expansion area will be investments in low- and zero-emission sources, including involvement in . the development of offshore wind energy. Thanks to the investments in new generation installations and a reduction . in the number of coal fired units, the Group's generation mix will change in 2030, when more than 65% of assets . will be low- and zero-emission installations, which is in line with the climate policy aimed at reducing emissions. . Investments in the modernization and development of a modern distribution grid aimed at maintaining the high level . of electricity deliveries will be continued. Being aware of the increase in ecological awareness among the public, . TAURON Group is also planning activities related to offering products and services in line with this market trend."
402,0.5833333333333334,"In its long-term planning TAURON Group takes into account the major importance of environment and climate . protection related issues. We are currently working on the assumptions for developing a new strategy. The main . guideline is to prepare development scenarios that will ensure long-term profitable business operations immune to . climate change and, at the same time, minimize the impact of the Group's operations on the environment by . reducing the emissions of the generation sources. The scenarios taken into account will depend on the intensity of . changes taking place in the environment, in particular on the assumptions of Poland’s Energy Policy, the decisions . taken by the government as part of the climate initiatives and regulatory directions shaped during the global climate . summits. The implementation of the European strategy of climate neutrality by 2050 will determine the shape of the . Polish energy sector in the long term, which will also be reflected in the strategic decisions of TAURON Group, . whose directional goals and actions should be a consistent response to the European and national guidelines . regarding the shape and model of the sector's functioning. TAURON Group will be steadfastly striving to further . diversify its generation sources in terms of the fuel used and to modernize its generation capacity."

The exception is customer service, where a slight drop was recorded, mainly due to the slightly lower results of . satisfaction with customer service over the online channels.

420,0.42857142857142855,"On the other hand, a decline in the survey results can be observed with respect to contracts, which is first and . foremost caused by a worse assessment of the aspect related to TAURON's willingness to negotiate non-price . terms of the contract, as well as with respect to products.

421,0.6,"A slight decrease in the level of general satisfaction and loyalty of TAURON group’s customers can be observed in . this edition of the survey,. The level of these two main indicators this year is average as compared to the . competition. However, it should be remembered that the samples of the competing companies’ customers surveyed . in the research project were small. Invariably, the most important areas for customers that affect their overall . satisfaction and loyalty (directly or indirectly) are failures and outages, prices and tariffs, image and customer . service. Prices have the biggest impact on the satisfaction of the SME segment customers and in this edition of the . survey they were rated at a similar level as in the previous edition of the survey. The prices that in this wave of the . survey were assessed similarly to the previous wave of the survey have the greatest impact on customer satisfaction . in the case of SME customers. Another important aspect - according to the analyses - is customer service, including, . in particular, telephone contact. This aspect is also rated, another year in a row, higher as compared to the previous . edition of the survey. At the same time, the overall customer service satisfaction is slightly lower. Invariably, very . important from the point of view of the impact on general satisfaction is also the company's image, which has . stabilized at a relatively good level since the previous edition of the survey. Failures are the aspects that have  . a smaller (but still significant and greater than last year) impact on the overall rating and customer loyalty. With . respect to failures the company is assessed by the SME customers at a similar level as in the previous year. At the . same time, customers from this segment have most likely experienced unplanned outages less frequently in the . last 12 months. The results of the SME customer satisfaction survey are presented in Figure no. 33."

441,0.9,"•  from the chiropterofauna monitoring:  ."
441,0.45,"In 2020, as part of the chiropterofauna monitoring, research was carried out in the winter shelters of bats and in . their feeding grounds. It was determined that 578 bats from 8 species hibernated in the winter shelters penetrated. . The condition of the population of the Horseshoe bat and the Geoffroy’s bat (bats from Annex II of the Habitats . Directive) in the winter shelters is suitable (FV assessment). In case of the lesser horseshoe bat, the large bed and . the crested bed a gradual increase in numbers is observed in the largest winter shelters of the Bat Cave (Jaskinia . Nietoperzowa) and the Racławicka Cave (Jaskinia Racławicka). In case of the other objects and bats, no negative . changes are observed as compared to the previous years, both in terms of the assessment of the number of bats . population and the condition of their habitats. The assessment of the habitat conditions at the Racławicka Cave . (Jaskinia Racławicka), one of the key winter shelters of the Kraków Upland, has not changed as compared to the . previous years. Two colonies of breeding bats of the Horseshoe bat and the Geoffroy’s bat were found in the . monastery in Czerna. In case of both species, the number of colonies was higher than in the previous years. The . hunting and field listening activities completed indicate that in the areas where trees were planted, the activity of . bats was slightly higher than the activity observed in the previous years."
441,0.95,"•  from the assessment of the conservation status of the natural habitats and the degree of damage to the . trees in the vicinity of the mine: ."
441,0.75,"The field studies conducted did not show any changes in the condition of the natural habitats and stands of trees in . the Eliaszówka nature reserve, in the Natura 2000 “Czerna” and “Dolinki Jurajskie” areas. Although the monitoring . of the conservation status of the natural habitats has shown that the condition of the natural habitats in this area is . unsatisfactory, but it is a confirmation of the previous assessments made as part of the State Environmental . Monitoring."
441,0.7,"The lower ratings of the conservation status of the natural habitats are mainly related to the disturbed composition . as well as the vertical and spatial structure of the stands of trees, which in turn stems from the earlier forest . management. The expansion of Impatiens parviflora may also have a significant impact on the deterioration of the . condition of the natural habitats. However, these indicators are not related to the exploitation of limestone at . Kopalnia „Czatkowice”."
441,0.35,"The observed damage to the tree trunks and the degree of defoliation do not differ significantly from the values . typical for similar stands of trees in this geographical region. The degree of damage increases with the age of trees . and is not significantly dependent on the distance from the mine. The combination of the botanical studies and the . data from the measurements of suspended dust also did not show any significant correlations that could result from . the negative impact of the concentration of suspended dust on the studied vegetation."
441,0.85,"•  from the ornithological monitoring in the protection zone (forested by the mine): ."
441,0.55,"A very large biodiversity of birds continued to be observed - 32 species in total, which is comparable to the . observations from the previous years. This diversity can be explained by the immaturity (different stages of . succession) of the described ecosystem and the impact of the ecotone factor, which is a sharply marked transition . zone between different biocenoses. In this case, the area covered by the study is surrounded by arable fields, . meadows and forests, which noticeably affect the monitored area."
441,0.5,"2 species from Annex 1 of the Birds Directive were found in 2020 - red-backed chrysanthemum and rowan. These . species are currently finding optimal conditions for growth in the area covered by the study."

446,0.24,"•  measures that enable reducing the global warming,"
446,0.28,"•  measures with respect to TAURON Group’s adaptation to the climate changes underway."
446,0.88,"The Policy is applicable to all of the Group’s subsidiaries, although each of them has detailed goals and tasks . stemming from the policy."
446,0.32,"Due diligence procedures and internal regulations"

446,0.8,"1)  Risk management - process based management of climate risk in the short, medium and long term (2020 -. 2025 - 2030) wis implemented starting from 2020."
446,0.44,"2)  Asset management - adaptation to the climate change, aimed at reducing the impact of the physical risks . related to the climate, has been included in TAURON Group’s asset management policy since 2020."
446,0.64,"3)  Human capital, employee training and recruitment management - the Group does not yet have a policy on the . employees that would reference the climate change, but is aware of the need to prepare such a policy in the . near future in order to invest in the skills necessary during the transition to the low-emission technologies in . the subsequent years."
446,0.52,"Due to the fact that three subsidiaries, TAURON Wytwarzanie, TAURON Ciepło and Nowe Jaworzno Grupa . TAURON, are covered by the obligation to participate in the so-called European Emissions Trading System (ETS), . the climate related issues are included in the operational decision making processes at such subsidiaries. In 2020, . the organizational regulations of TAURON Polska Energia S.A. changes took place as a result of which the Climate . Area was established. Changes were introduced to the organizational regulations of TAURON Polska Energia S.A. . in 2020, as a result of which the Climate Area was established."
446,0.4,"Adaptation to climate change"
446,0.2,"TAURON Group’s Climate Policy defines the basic priorities with respect to the adaptation to the climate change. . The gradual adaptation of the production assets to the consequences of extreme weather occurrences and volatility . of weather conditions, in particular in case of the Lines of Business sensitive to the volatility of temperature, rainfall . and wind strength, is implemented as part of the system-wide approach to Asset Management."
446,0.6,"Also with respect to the new operations or investment projects, the risks associated with the climate change are . taken into account, as an additional criterion for the assessment thereof, in particular the physical risks, when . placing (siting) new investment projects."
446,0.36,"Based on the document Poland’s Environmental (Ecological) Policy 2030 and the ISOK (National IT Protection . System) portal, regions were identified that were more exposed to the physical risk related to climate, in order to . prioritize the adaptation of the assets to climate change in the regions potentially more exposed to acute or long-. term physical risk related to climate. The Group's assets are mostly located in southern Poland, which, according . to the data disclosed in Poland’s Environmental (Ecological) Policy 2030 and in the ISOK system, is less exposed . to desertification than the areas of central Poland. Due to their location, the Group's assets are also outside the . area that may be transforming due to the forecast sea level rise."
446,0.68,"Due to the cooling systems used, TAURON Group’s conventional power plants are much less exposed to the need . to reduce production due to the shortage of water than the power plants with the so-called open cooling systems. . The above factor puts TAURON at an advantage as compared to the other energy groups operating in Poland and . in Europe."
446,0.92,"The consequences of the extreme weather conditions are most strongly felt by TAURON Ekoenergia and TAURON . Dystrybucja subsidiaries."
446,0.48,"At TAURON Ekoenergia, the hydrological drought and uneven precipitation, resulting in longer periods with no . rainfall, intermittent abrupt precipitation (torrential rains) periodically lead to the inability to generate electricity.

This marathon of creativity on climate protection was held on-line in 2020, and . was devoted to the issue of drought in the city. The concept of Climathon is to jointly develop solutions responding . to specific climate challenges at the given place, during 24-hour events that take place simultaneously in more than . 100 cities around the world in 47 countries.

The operations . related to the burning of fossil fuels, which are the core business operations of TAURON Wytwarzanie, TAURON . Ciepło and Nowe Jaworzno Grupa TAURON, as well as unorganized emissions of methane into the atmosphere . from Zakład Górniczy Brzeszcze (Brzeszcze Coal Mine), owned by TAURON Wydobycie, are important sources of . greenhouse gas emissions. Methane emissions come from the mine ventilation, over which the company has no . direct influence and cannot control it in a technically justified manner. The emissions constitute the so-called off-. balance sheet methane emissions, which are calculated and included in the charges for the use of the environment . for the business purposes."
451,0.76,"In addition, ZG Brzeszcze is equipped with a mine methane extraction (drainage) plant, in which, in 2020, 100% of . methane was obtained and utilized (sold) in the quantity of approx. 40 million Nm3 of methane, thus it was not a . source of direct methane emissions to the atmosphere and was used in the combustion processes by external . entities as an energy source."
451,0.56,"Direct greenhouse gas emissions due to the secondary operations of TAURON Wytwarzanie, TAURON Ciepło, . Nowe Jaworzno Grupa TAURON, as well as the Group’s other subsidiaries do not account for a significant share . and, above all, are related to the combustion of fuels in the engines of the production machines and cars.
