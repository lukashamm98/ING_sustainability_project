Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities . outside of the US. These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general . costs and expenses incurred outside the US. Since the cash held by these QHCs is available to the Parent, AES uses the combined measure . of subsidiary distributions to Parent and QHCs as a useful measure of cash available to the Parent to meet its international liquidity needs."
